"At the beginning of 21st century, the western IT industry was in urgent need of an ideological basis for the promotion of its products, so it started to actively exploit the concept of “technological singularity.” Invented by fantasy writer Vernor Vinge, this concept comes from the observations of the exponential acceleration of progress in some areas of human activity. Based on these particular (quite particular) cases, the conclusion was made about the imminent appearance of computer superintelligence that would improve itself in such unrestricted and incomprehensible ways resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.However, “technological singularity” loses its popularity in the 2020s due to the failure of some related fantasies. First came the bankruptcy of “nanotech” companies that had mastered huge budgets but could not create promised “nanobots.” Then, the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble began deflating. It turned out that successful machine learning (ML) used to solve particular tasks could not be scaled to wider classes of practical problems. At the same time, already implemented AI solutions required more and more human resources to train ML models, correct multiple AI errors and provide security for those over-complicated systems. In the view of all these troubles, the idea of “general/strong AI” was dumped the same way as previously discarded dreams of “philosophical stone,” “universal medicine” and “ideal wife.”  Finally, the very concept of “technological singularity” is declared a destructive cult and banned in some countries. The reason for this: accelerating growth usually ends either by a smooth fade (S-shaped curve of population dynamics) or by a sharp avalanche (stock market crash). Avalanches are common for overheated and super-connected systems which are too fragile due to power law distribution: a small number of elements can drastically influence all the others. That’s exactly what happened after the active distribution of uniform digital technologies: most people on Earth use the same search engine, the same social network, the same company’s smartphones, etc. In this fragile word, technological avalanches can become a big problem even without superintelligence, threatening to throw humanity back to the level of the Middle Ages. For this reason, the destructive cult of singularity is displaced by more meaningful doctrines of technobiological diversity and harmony."
"A place suffered from flooding twice yearly &, while it was waiting for millions of dollars to improve the draining system, it should have developed automatically triggered motorboats & floating warehouses to be used once a flood alarm was activated. Once the river water level reaches a critical level, the town shall have a floating warehouse (an inflatable warehouse with air and material strong enough to cope with floods) ready and allow low-lying residences to store their valuable assets in this floating warehouse. When there is a flood, motorboat rescue teams shall take all residents of low-lying land to a victims center on higher ground. Their valuable assets such as home appliances and furniture can all pre-stored at the floating warehouse to reduce losses. A special zone on higher ground shall be set aside for car owners to park their car."
"Indonesian culture is still quite strong in the future and is closely related to the digital era. The statues and monuments will remain there, in hologram form. High and modern buildings will be built for housing, but there will still be a touch of local culture in the buildings in the form of carvings, batik, and even the shape of the roof of the building."
"Carbon credit has just become a new internationally-acknowledged currency.  Carbon-consuming activities such as driving petrol-fueled cars will consume carbon credit and people can earn credits from recycling and environmentally friendly activities. In addition to trading in cash and cryptocurrency, people are beginning to trade in carbon credits."
"Since we're in the race to stop climate change & global warming, one of the main goals to achieve to win the race is to eliminate large amounts of CO² – & among the big producers of CO² are fossil-fueled cars. Many people see EVs (Electric Vehicles) as the alternative to the traditional oil-powered cars of today, but the lack of power station infrastructure is one factor that decelerates the rise of EVs. I thought: why can't EVs run on power from cloud computing. So here's my concept to power it: All EV batteries are made with a specialized AI Chip consisting of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter or induction coil produces an electromagnetic field which transfers the energy across the gap to the corresponding induction coil in the receiving device. The receiver then converts the energy received from the magnetic field to usable electric current which is then used to charge the battery.  Unlike wired & tubed chargers, they can be centrally monitored and controlled via cloud connectivity. Software applications can start and stop charging based on the battery charge status. An onboard microcontroller is present for Data Logging, Remote Management and Control from a central location and to connect the chargers through the cloud. In addition, the charger can log data related to its usage including its on status, charging period, disconnected status, and the like. Since we're in the era of 5G & the ""Internet of Things"", this can be done. "
"The pandemic that has been with us for the past two years has changed the way people think about their health. For many, it led to a realization about how vulnerable the human immune system can be, and today, in most countries, wearing medical masks in public places has already become the norm. At the same time, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of such safeguarding measures. But what if scientists manage to develop a ‘smart mask’ that could not only 100% protect a person from viruses, but also eliminate all negative environmental impacts? According to a Kaspersky study, 59% of healthcare workers agree that they would wear a smart mask with embedded sensors to analyze the general air quality and block pollution and viruses, following mass development, even if it is not required by government measures.  "
"Can you imagine what a visit to the doctor’s would look like in 20 or 30 years? It’s highly likely that, in the future, it will be very different to what we experience now. Medical technologies are developing rapidly and already actively helping doctors to make diagnoses. But what further potential does technology have? What do physicians think about the changes that may occur in their profession in the future? Kaspersky interviewed medical professionals around the world to find out their opinions on one of the most common futuristic theories: will technologies be able to completely replace doctors? 37% of global respondents agree that it may happen with the help of AI, cloud, big data, and robotics in just 20 years, and 43% believe such technologies will completely replace psychologists. But what about the readiness to entrust our health to machines? Quite a substantial number of physicians are quite confident about the capacity of future technologies. 40% of global healthcare professionals agree they would be happy to recommend that their relatives have surgery done by robots when it becomes a possibility.  "
"Is technology capable of answering one of the most crucial and mysterious questions of human life: when and how will I die? According to the Kaspersky survey, almost half (48%) of physicians believe that it is possible. Professionals do not preclude that medical technologies will become so advanced that they could accurately predict the year and cause of death in just 20 years.This scenario is not far from reality. The more data – including information about the health and life expectancy of different people – that is collected around the world by various devices and services, the more accurate AI predictions based on this data probably will be. Of course, such forecasts will not be 100% accurate as a person's life expectancy does not only depend on the indicators that can be analyzed.But does everyone want to know when and how their lives will end? The consequences of such a revelation could be unpredictable.Will it lead to mass depression, as people realize the transience of life, or will we, on the contrary, reconsider our approach to life and enjoy every moment of it?Will people become more health conscious to try and change the prediction, or ‘go all out’ knowing that they have lots of time?How secure and private will such information be and how can we ensure that it won’t be used for blackmail or speculation?	 "
"Documentaries like ""The Social Dilemma"" show how former executives from technology corporations restate their fear about artificial intelligence's role in social media and the influence these platforms have on society. One concludes that the more you know about how the digital world works, the more aware of the potential dangers you become. Today there is an increasing interest in technology jobs amongst the young population, mainly because of the high demand for technology professionals from thousands of tech companies. Paradoxically, by 2035 this phenomenon may lead to a deceleration of the consumption of digital products and services, since more people will be knowledgeable about how the digital world works.Today's young professionals and the future parents of the next generation will be much more cautious and will have more mechanisms to protect their privacy and personal data. They will be way more selective in their consumption of digital products. This scenario could also lead to more responsible and ethical development of digital products."
"The metaverse is everywhere and contains almost everything: Your digital persona, all your social life, your favorite sources of entertainment, sports, your meetings and interactions at work, your favorite clothes and your NFT art. Most daily activities are performed by your virtual avatar in the metaverse. You digital image is way more important than your physical appearance.It feels almost like you live a parallel life in the Metaverse. It has become absolutely necessary for your existence. It is very difficult to be operational outside of the Metaverse. You are connected via multiple devices, wearables and even brain chips. You live in a mixed reality where physical and digital converge. Virtual immersion has evolved to the point that you question what should be considered to be real. Many people opt to spend most of their day in virtual worlds where they can become whoever they want and live the way they always dreamed."
"New Manila Bay - City of Pearl is located at the heart of Manila, a shining jewel in the ocean. The 407 hectares of land form the biggest self-sustaining Smart City in Asia, planned to host more than 500,000 citizens and creating over 100,000 jobs.The UAA Kinming Development group received approval from the Philippines government for the vision and project, with Gohan Concepts and HPA Architects providing essential strategy and visual components. Construction will begin in 2022, and the city will welcome the first residents in 2030."
"With the rapid growth of social media platforms and apps over the past decade and the increase in access to virtual reality (lower hardware costs and growth in platforms), social media will become a fully immersive and virtual experience. Social platforms and users (all of us) will have a new and improved way to interact with other users. VR technology will be sophisticated enough that users will be unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between Virtual Social Reality and real life. Startups will offer luxuries and conveniences to users who are fully immersed (haptic suits/chairs, nutritional IVs and defecation IVs). There will also be a sharper divide between the Haves (users) and the Have Nots (tech support and maintenance). All currency will be digital, and users will be able to get jobs and monetize within platforms. They can make new friends, get married, grow their status, and live the life they always dreamed of."
"The world will be crowded by drones instead of a swarm of people in the locality, people will use VR to travel using drones, while recharging wirelessly on the go and traveling around the world whilst sitting in the comfort of their own home. The world will no longer fear viral contaminations as physical tourism is pretty much rendered non-existent and the world is entirely experienced virtually in real-time, thanks to ingenious advancements in drones and UAVs in the near future."
Humans will not have an unconscious bias regarding gender and sexual orientation. Individuals will not be even asked or questioned about those characteristics. All humans will be treated the same with no distinctions or discrimination.Many gender neutral names will be given to babies and binary languages will rapidly adopt more neutral gender forms and nouns.A bisexual or genderfluid superhero will be seen as absolutely normal. The traditional concept of the family will be re-evaluated. Individuals will have more freedom to fluctuate between what today are considered gender specific behaviors without feeling constrained. Fashion will also evolve towards a gender expired society.
"The famous clock that sits on the banks of the river Thames has currently got an analog clock face. But sadly it won't be around for too long. 'Big Ben' will have to upgrade, due to people not knowing the analog clock anymore. It will be a 2-year project but after a long time. The clock will start to work again in the year 2030, but people will have to wait till the year 2032 to see the full clock."
"""It is the year 2046. Everything that you do is measured or monitored. Trillions of sensors track where you go, what you do, how is your health, your gut, what are you thinking, how do you feel and what do you dream about. Every product you use is designed to capture information. Billions of algorithms are constantly making predictions about your preferences and what you will do next. You feel that, although you accepted this reality, at the end, it had a high price and you have lost your freedom. For the first time you experience how every decision you make, has an impact in how your life progresses. Because everything is automatically identified, measured, captured and transferred to multiple artificial intelligences that get to know you better than yourself.Fortunately, you have ways to remember that feeling of freedom. You can have access to virtual worlds that you feel and experience like real. Worlds where there are no sensors, no AIs, no predictions or algorithms. Worlds where is just you,  where you feel you can keep your secrets, where you do not feel observed or under analysis. Worlds where you can even make huge mistakes or misbehave. Worlds where you do not feel you are the product. But you also know that all that you do in this virtual worlds is data that is being transferred to multiple AIs in your real world. It does not matter because, at the end, your virtual freedom is priceless."
"In future, sex toys will still play a role in helping people to experience and enrich their sexuality. Despite the digitalization of our dating habits, and an increasingly distanced world, when it comes to sex — whether solo or with a partner — physicality and the need for real touch will still prevail. Through devices such as special gloves, helmets, glasses, or other toys, paired with your own imagination, it will be possible to dive into a virtual world and experience eroticism on another level. To experience the touch, caress, or scent of a loved one is something humans have been striving for since time immemorial. Toys or robots can make excellent complements to this desire, although they are unlikely to fully replace human contact in the years to come.  "
"The current level of development of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics presents an alternative to human communication. In 2030 there will be special dating apps allowing users to talk to virtual dates, flirt and make them feel special. As soon as the virtual date says “I want to get to know you more,” the app will indicate that you have made the AI partner fall in love with you.Looking back at history, there was, for example, the video game LovePlus, which captured the hearts of many Japanese people by mimicking the experience of being in a relationship. The male-centered game had three different “girlfriends” – Rinko, Nene, and Manaka, each with unique characteristics. The goal was for the player to court one of them by earning “boyfriend” points for doing things correctly. Another case was the virtual girl in the RealDollX app. The rules were very simple: the user installed the app, chose an avatar for the AI girl, and started communicating. In addition to physical characteristics, users could choose the personality of their “girlfriend” (intelligent, jealous, unpredictable, helpful, spiritual, etc.). The user could also customize the “girlfriend’s” voice. Generally, it was like a Sims game with selectable character traits. "
"Being alone is no longer the taboo it once was. As old stereotypes about needing a partner or being married lose relevance, people are increasingly choosing for themselves whether to be single or not. In 2021 more than 37.5 million American adults live alone. In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland – countries with some of the highest living standards – about 40% of households consist of just one person. By the year 2030 this percentage will have increased by 50% or more, depending on the country. The numbers show that millions of people around the world are living single lives devoid of long-term or serious romantic relationships. Such people are called ""singletons"".  Collectivism, including family life, is, for the most part, a relic of the past. Instead, these people live for the sake of self-development, and their lifestyle is progressive. Love becomes more about attitude than feeling. Every interaction has its own level of intensity, even virtual communication. If a conversation feels good – even in an exchange with chatbots – “happy hormones”, such as serotonin and dopamine, form in the brain. These hormones, which allow us to feel love, are produced not only when we meet in person. From a psychological point of view, we feel that love for robots and avatars is no longer a futuristic fantasy. This could lead us to differentiate the role of singletons much more in the future, as they are able to satisfy their longing for commitment through technology. Completely new forms of relationships are emerging, and we will increasingly find that these too are beneficial. That they feel real.  "
"A number of high-profile hacking incidents have led to an increasing demand from politicians and the media for a computer lockdown.During the late twenties, Apple was first in requiring a certified Apple Developer account in order to run XCode or any other development tool on MacOS. Windows followed suit in the thirties with their Trusted Cloud Developer Initiative. Finally, the purchase of ""PC"" class devices (already in decline for two decades),now requires you to present government ID and, starting in 2045, you must present a Certified Programmer's License only available to large companies and wealthy individuals. Computer Science degrees had been phasing out actual programming classes for a long time, instead emphasizing courses on economic theory and data mining.While there is a very small black market in unrestricted legacy devices, such devices cannot run modern code and cannot connect to the internet and are therefore of limited interest to the public. Overall, citizens welcome the new measures because they protect them from hackers and also prevent child abuse. Consequently, the media has not reported on any such crimes ever since.These measures complete a long journey towards computer safety. Storing your own data outside of the cloud has been subject to special restrictions since the 2030s. ""Computer hacking"" was classified as a capital offense in the United States, China, and Singapore in 2034. The Commercial Software Integrity Act of 2029 has made it a criminal offense for users to circumvent any kind of restriction put in place by the publisher of a program."
"In the future, due to concerns about e-waste and its growing amount, a new type of universal personal computing device is released: This device has no screen and relatively modest specifications, the motherboard being about the size of a modern phone's. The case of this device has exposed pins for data and power transfer, allowing modules of different types to be connected, or multiple devices to be connected together for a more powerful node of devices that operates as a single unit.Some of the most notable modules will be a battery/touch screen combo module that will allow the device to operate as a smartphone.Similarly, a laptop-shaped dock with a keyboard, screen, dedicated graphics compute module (a CPU with no dedicated graphic drawing commands, rather using software to draw to a screen) and a built in battery for on the go note taking or gaming."
"Imagine a world where physical pregnancies are a relic of the past and have been effectively automated out of existence. Thanks to ever-improving healthcare, artificial intelligence, and biomedical engineering, parents can watch their children develop in incubation systems from zygote to fetus anywhere and any time through their electronic devices, without the need for an actual pregnancy to occur. While this will greatly benefit women in developed countries with accessible healthcare benefits, it will also cause divisions within various socioeconomic groups, unless it is covered under federal medical care plans as a right and not a privilege. Women's workforce participation will continue to increase, which will help close the gender wage gap and motherhood penalty. However, there will also be active protests against this technology by religious institutions, private corporations and political parties, among others, which could potentially raise ethical concerns about its external and internal validity amongst civilians at large."
"Along with an improvement in technology and science, by the year of 2050, people's social interactions and relationships will change drastically. Hardly any book will be available or read; rather than reading, people will prefer to watch or listen. Art and music culture will be completely changed, only rap- and bass-based music will dominate the music culture - maybe techno too, but not so often. Art will be exhibited only in digital form, and the paper-and-pencil era will come to an end. Most jobs will no longer need employment: machines will generally handle the hard work. There will be few languages spoken and most languages will be dead, however people will not need translation anymore - they will be able to speak and understand multiple languages thanks to some special chips. Marriages will no longer happen, and neither will love, family or friendships. People will only interact with each other for specific reasons; short relationships will be based on mutual interests. Emotional void and depression will be common disorders; however drugs will be used commonly as well, and besides, they will be prescribed by doctors. There will be no religion; people will become so realistic and only focus on everyday work. The cinema culture will be 3D based. It will be so realistic that you can actually live the movie. People need less sleep and less food; reproduction will decrease dramatically. A lot of animal species will be extinct, exotic plants and animals will commonly be present in homes. Everything that can be produced will already be produced and nearly everything will be available for humans; we will just focus on consuming. Memory-based disorders will be common, and although nearly all physical disorders will be curable, people will suffer from disorders mentally. Crime rates will decrease all around the world; criminals will be used for scientific experiments."
"In 2045, humans will actively interact with AI mentors. Those entities will be present in our lives from the very beginning, they will accompany our whole lives and will join us to navigate our coursework and personal life. They will teach, support, coach, and mentor us to achieve our life goals."
"Automation will increasingly make the human labor force obsolete. If we want to avoid a horrible dystopia, we need to keep humans in the economy without jobs. UBI (Universal Basic Income) is an obvious solution, but a very flawed one I think.South Korea is working on another solution, ""Robot Taxes"", where a company that uses robots needs to pay a tax, which is then used to finance qualification programs for people who lost their jobs to those robots.I have come up with a third alternative. In my version of the automated future, every robot needs a license to be owned and run. Nobody can own and operate a robot without one of those licenses. The only holders of such licenses are humans. Every human being gets a certain number of Robot Ownership Licenses: ROLs. Those are permanently linked to you as a legal entity. You cannot sell or lose those licenses, but you can rent them out.What the ideal number is, is a detail that would need to be figured out, but just for the sake of explaining the concept, let us say every human gets five ROLs. You want a self-driving car and a house cleaning robot? That eats up two of your ROLs and leaves you with three.(To clarify, by ""eating them up"" I do not mean they are lost. They are just occupied slots as long as you own those robots. As soon as you get rid of your Roomba, for example, the ROL is freed up again.)(I am calling it a ""Robot Operation License"" instead of ""Robot Ownership License"", because robots need to be built and stored before someone buys them, of course, and the company that builds them cannot use up a ROL for every robot it produces. So, it would have to go active the moment you start operating a robot.)However, in our example, three spare ROLs are not used, so you can rent them out.You register three of your ROLs at a ROL Exchange, comparable to a stock exchange, or you go directly to someone who wants to rent them and do a bilateral contract with them.Let us say a corporation wants to build a new factory and needs 1000 robots to run that factory. So they go to the ROL exchange and rent 1000 ROLs from people who are offering their spare ROLs there, so they are allowed to build that factory.How much they have to pay to rent a ROL per month depends on supply and demand. Of course, they want some planning safety and want to know that they can run their new factory for a longer time, so they want to rent those 1000 ROLs for a period of ten years. As the owner of three of those ROLs, you of course are hesitant to rent them out for that long. What if you want to buy an autonomous lawn mower next year?So, the price for renting your ROLs for a long time goes up. The corporation is willing to pay a premium, so they can get the ROLs for ten years.This way, humans would not have to be afraid of large-scale automation. You lose your job to a robot? Does not matter, because the demand for your ROLs has gone up and you make a lot of money by renting them out. In a way you are still selling your productivity as a human, you just do not do it by working yourself anymore.Humans, as legal entities, as holders of ROLs, as entrepreneurs and as consumers, would stay relevant in the economy, perhaps even become more relevant than ever before, because they cannot be separated from the ROL, the thing that runs the economy.Whenever a robot creates wealth, at least one, usually two humans (the owner of the ROL and the employer of the robot) take part in that wealth.I know that sounds kind of Socialist, but there just is no way around the fact that we need to come up with a way to keep the coming robot economy attached to us humans and not just a tiny handful of humans who own the robots.I think ROLs would be better than some Robot Tax the government can easily mess up, and it would be better than Universal Basic Income, because it would not be a handout, it would be a business transaction and the fact that ROLs would be a kind of tradable commodity would keep the capitalism in the solution. Smarter people could find smarter ways to turn their ROLs into money, or found businesses comparable to hedge funds, that take other people's ROLs and ""invest"" them in the most profitable way. If the economy takes a nose dive for some reason and fewer robots are needed, the price of ROLs would fall and everybody would have to adjust, instead of the government being stuck with paying people a fixed amount of money per month, as would be the case with UBI.Everybody would be made an entrepreneur with a valuable commodity to trade, but with minimal risk, because the worst that could happen to you is that you are stupid and rent out your ROLs for too low a price, but you would still participate in the wealth the robots are creating and could still go search for a regular job. Also, there would be no inflation problems as could be caused by Universal Basic Income. We would literally just add a new dimension to the economy, without the need for handouts, and everybody could profit from automation, without robbing people of their individuality, or their responsibility for what they do with their ROLs.The good thing about that system would be that we would not really have to alter the existing economy, nobody would get dispossessed, no superhuman level of discipline and restraint would be necessary, unlike in Communism or other utopic ideologies, it would not violate human nature and would not require people to be better than they are in order for it to work.People could still be greedy and Wall Street Gordon Gekko types could come up with options and derivatives for trading ROLs and let their demonic creativity run freely, as they do with the regular stuff they are trading. But the big difference would be that due to the fact that ROLs are inseparably linked to humans, they could not do it in some Ivory Tower strata, where only they profit from it and everyone else can go to hell. You, as the source of what they are trading, would get dragged along into wealth. Unlike money, land or even your labor, you could not be separated from the thing that generates the wealth. No matter how clever the schemes they come up with to maximize profits, no matter how psychopathic the CEO of the corporation, you, as an inseparable component of the thing they need, would still have to profit with them. In a way it would mean a commodification and monetization of your worth as a human, which sounds bad and dystopian at first glance, but is a good thing when you think about it, because it would mean that worth and your identity as a human being would get infused and enshrined in the mechanizations of the economy instead of being ignored and trampled by it. Corporations, governments and A.I. would have a vested, very concrete interest in keeping people alive and happy. You know how people use capitalism to save the environment? Endangered species in Africa and elsewhere have been saved by kind of monetizing them. By building a regulated, professional hunting tourism industry, you created a financial incentive to saving and taking care of those animals and of the habitats they need. Saving them became profitable and so people actually did it.ROLs would basically do the same to your worth as a human being. It would monetize that worth, creating financial incentives for corporations, governments and AI to respect, value and preserve that worth, while making sure that it cannot be separated from you.The evidence that welfare did a lot of harm to certain communities can hardly be denied. Welfare incentivized divorce and single motherhood because single mothers get more welfare than married mothers. It created whole generations of kids growing up without fathers and in a culture where welfare was considered the norm, not the exception and had no stigma anymore.I am afraid UBI would do the same and crank it up to eleven, while at the same time fueling inflation, rent hikes and criminality, because when the criminals know everyone in a poor neighborhood has more money, there is more to steal.Imagine the following alternative: A bunch of young men in ""the hood"" have long discussions and exchange tips and tricks on how best to make money with their ROLs, instead of living in this welfare culture and engaging in crime out of sheer boredom. Is it not then a logical next step, that after finding the best ways to turn their ROLs into money, they also will spend time thinking how best to invest that money?Also, other than welfare, ROLs could actually have a preservative effect on marriages and families. After all, when you live together with someone, you only need to use up one of your ROLs for a house robot, instead of one each, which means together as a family, you have more ROLs freed up to rent out.The biggest hurdle for the implementation of that system would be to figure out what qualifies as a robot that needs a ROL to be owned and what does not, but that does not seem like a very big obstacle. You could just say that any machine or piece of software that can achieve certain things without direct human input would qualify as a robot that requires a ROL.And a Robot Tax would have that to figure out too, so this is not a drawback unique to ROL.Then we would only have to figure out how many ROLs each human gets, whether you get them from birth or only when you reached a certain age, whether they can be revoked as a punishment for certain crimes or not (I would opt for not, because as I said, the ROL would ultimately be a currency-made representation of your worth as a human being and thus should be untouchable). Whether your parents can decide what happens to yours before a certain age and other details, like what happens to the ROLs of sick and severely handicapped people.Another thing, of course, is what happens when someone dies while their ROLs are rented by someone else.As I said, I first talked about this idea many years ago, in YouTube comments too, but nobody cared. I hope the increasing urgency of the automation subject matter will mean that people are engaging with ideas like that.I think people do not like handouts and welfare. Whenever possible, governments gave out free land rather than handouts and people responded better to that.Whether it was the Roman Empire compensating its legionaries with land, settler societies sending their poor into the wilderness to make their fortunes there, or dictators doing ""land reforms"" to appease the masses, people prefer owning something that generates income over being handed a pittance.What I think is good about my ROL idea is that it would take the thing that is going to destroy the job market, the robots and AI, and in a way, turn it into a new form of ""virtual land"". Instead of handouts (UBI), people would get a piece of ""virtual land"" they can either rent out or use themselves, and unlike real land, the fact that they cannot sell it means it cannot all be soaked up by a handful of big players. I think that is a crucial difference from UBI and makes ROLs something truly different. And I have not even mentioned other advantages yet. ROL would not really need to be financed in the same way as UBI. We could basically just conjure it out of thin air, if we as a society decided to do so, without having to worry about where we get the money from, or what happens if there is an economic downturn and the government has trouble coming up with the money to hand out.The free market would decide how much the rent for a ROL is worth at a given time. Supply and Demand and the money would come directly out of the increase of productivity the robots generate. If a lot of robots are being used, a lot of ROLs are needed and the prize rises. If not as many robots are needed, nobody needs to come up with any money to hand out to the people. It would be a self-regulating system.The only way the government would need to get involved is in deciding how many ROLs each citizen gets and policing that nobody operates robots without an ROL.That, of course, is an issue, but no more so than any other such kind of regulation. It would be relatively easy to figure out if somebody is producing and selling a lot of stuff, without employing humans, or renting ROLs.A Robot Tax would need the same kind of policing, and UBI would need to be policed too. We could also look at the coming flood of automation and bots like a wave of newly arriving immigrants. Instead of having to compete with them, we turn the humans into virtual landlords who do not need jobs anymore, because they make their money by renting out (virtual) living space to the bots who took all the jobs."
"By 2050, 97+% of the world's individuals will be participating in, and fully reliant upon, a “Shadow Economy” that is outside a country’s official national economy or even the world's economy. It will address most, if not all, of their economic needs and provide mechanisms whereby they can exchange “instruments of value"" for ""goods and services"". Financial transactions within the shadow economy will be conducted with unofficial financial instruments (for example, Shadow-Dollars) and used to make “purchases” of goods and services. Small businesses will arise (e.g. manufactures, boutique medical suppliers, repair works, etc.) that will trade exclusively with Shadow-Dollars and operate in a manner that avoids any scrutiny of the official economy.This Shadow Economy will arise as individuals will no longer have access to the official economy, because most of the world’s generated wealth, and the ability to generate wealth itself, will have been transferred into the hands of a few companies or individuals. This will likely come about because of automation, displacement by artificial intelligence and advanced robotics.Considerations and BackgroundBy 2023, the annual global total value of electronic payments alone is expected to exceed US $3 trillion and maybe even reach US $5.5 trillion. This is expected to represent roughly 7% to 15% of the world's financial transactions in that year (some analysts think this value may be too conservative). By 2050, we can expect this total value to have expanded exponentially. By the year 2050, we may see the world’s annual total financial transaction value exceed “thousands of trillions” of US dollars, maybe even “tens of thousands of trillions” of dollars. It is very hard to accurately predict, but by 2050, the total value of the world’s financial exchange will dwarf everything ever previously considered. It will be so large that some small governments will not be able to participate. Furthermore, even the biggest governments will not be able to fully participate. Only the richest and biggest players will be able to fully participate.Business without Humans and Data-TsunamisBy 2050, the world’s total number of electronic financial transactions in one hour alone far exceeds the entire number of financial transactions for the whole year of 2025. By today’s standards, the volume of data processed in 2050 can only be described as a “Data Tsunami”. Advanced AIs manage whole teams of specialist AIs to ensure the robustness of the financial transactions and the systems they run on. AIs that specialize in security watch each bit and byte and scan for anomalies in real time.Simultaneously, in mere milliseconds, even more specialist AIs do the work that an entire team of Human paralegals would take months to perform. Entire contractual arrangements are started, negotiated, and completed in under a second. Businesses and vast sums of money change hands faster than Governments and the public are able to witness or even consider.The volumes of data are so vast and so arcane that only highly advanced and specialized AIs running on the most optimized and advanced hardware can review some of it by random inspection."
"Enough genetic material to resurrect a viable population of Homo Neanderthalensis and Home Erectus has been collected. Additionally, sufficient knowledge has been garnered to proceed, albeit with some minor technical hurdles.Whilst the cultures of these people could never be replaced or fully reconstructed, serious facsimiles or ""best guesses"" could be established to give these people a running start at self-sufficiency.Ethical consideration for such a project would need to be resolved before such a project would, or even should, begin."
"In 2040, authorities in China began the largest centralized collection of data in the history of humanity.The ambitious project, called ""Total Quantified Society"", is aimed at nothing less than a complete pacification of the “four evils”: crime, disease, ignorance, and poverty.To fight crime, every person living in China is required to submit detailed biometric data. This includes a blood sample for genetic sequencing, an ultra-high resolution 3D scan of the head, a three-minute speech sample, a three-minute video of one typing on a phone and a keyboard, a 500-word handwriting sample on a political topic, a 3D recording of one walking, running, climbing stairs, and performing a series of simple tasks with their hands. Additionally, fingerprints, footprints, and high-resolution pictures of one’s arms, hands, feet, teeth, and any distinguishing marks are taken. Criminals currently serving prison sentences and those with past criminal convictions are subjected to further studies. These include microbiome samples, bone biopsy to track past environmental exposures, detailed biographical data surveys, psychological questionnaires, and interviews with friends, relatives, and teachers. To fight disease, randomly selected families, comprising five percent of China's population and representing a broad cross-section of the Chinese society, will be required to submit biological samples every two weeks. Drafted families will be required to submit blood, saliva, hair, skin, stool, urine, and microbiome samples. Additionally, environmental samples are collected from the family’s home and workplace. After analysis, samples are kept frozen in a vast decentralized network of underground vaults, so researchers can access the samples in the future.Two percent of the drafted families are required to participate in further, more time-consuming and intrusive studies every four months. These include psychological questionnaires, life satisfaction and sociological questionnaires, cognitive tests, physical condition tests, and medical imaging. They must also wear smart watches designed to monitor movement, sleep patterns, the frequency of social interactions, body temperature, and heart rate. To fight ignorance, randomly selected newborns, comprising 0.1 % of all Chinese births, will participate in the children's development census. The newborns will be given toys fitted with cameras and microphones; the devices will monitor and record the child from the moment they were born until they reach puberty: every sight, sound, social interaction, along with the child's eye movement and reaction, will be recorded and tagged (first by humans, then by AI). The aim is to understand how early childhood environment correlates with future life and education outcomes. The data from the children’s development census is also fed to a neural network to see if it is possible to teach a neural net to understand the world as a human child does. Finally, to fight poverty, physical cash is abolished and everyone in China is required to use e-payments. Every transaction is recorded in a non-anonymized central database. Every week, a free government-run accounting software tool will give everyone an overview of their weekly spending, their assets, savings and accrued liabilities and offer warnings and suggestions, should one spend money in a manner the government deems “unwise”.All goods sold in China over the price of 50 yuan are embedded with a small RFID chip allowing the government to quickly audit a person’s material possessions and track the life cycle of every item sold. Key locations such as apartment entrances, post offices, and trash containers, are fitted with RFID scanners allowing the government to track the flow of individual goods through its life cycle. By law, every business must prominently display the real-life usage statistics of the item they intend to sell. Companies that make especially durable and useful goods are rewarded with tax breaks, whereas companies making goods that quickly end up in the trash receive a tax penalty.This program, which opponents decry as a gross violation of privacy and human rights, nonetheless receives broad support from the Chinese public. Several factors contribute to the support: the devastation caused by COVID-19 a decade ago was still fresh in people's minds; an aging population, plunging birth rates and panic over fertility created a newfound focus on health; a rising middle class increasingly fearful of crime, and a nationalist belief that China's big data-driven society will offer China a permanent competitive advantage over the more privacy-oriented West."
"Even in the year 2047, there are still prisons on Earth. Detention conditions, however, have much improved, and initiatives aimed at teaching convicts to earn an honest living have entered a new stage of evolution. Robotization has rendered manual labor uneconomic, so detainees stopped felling trees and sewing pillowcases – and changed to computers.The future is opening up new career opportunities for convicts in the digital domain. Large IT companies have agreed to give them jobs. Inmates recognize text, audio and photos, creating datasets for training AI on.Another initiative came from video game development studios: they are hiring prisoners to drive racecars in racing simulators and monsters, in horror games. According to the developers, this is significantly cheaper than creating realistic AI, with each playthrough and each race following a unique scenario. Creators of MMORPGs decided to keep up with their peers: inmates train newbies and control NPCs (non-player characters): assign and accept quests, sort out difficult situations and mark spots on the map. According to creators, this adds depth and realism to gameplay.One of the most advanced projects is game moderation in virtual reality. Program members act as cyberpolice, catching offenders that use inappropriate avatars or language. The most diligent moderators get bonuses and even have their sentences reduced. "
"The 2040 NFL season will see the kickoff of an all-avatar game. Twenty-two players (eleven on each side) will not be suiting up but setting up from some formatted room inside a luxury stadium, with only their team jersey, headset and controller. Their avatars will take the field as life-like holograms that everyone in the stadium will be able to see through their e-contacts.The NFL is no longer contained to just the United States, but rather a forty-team league of the most elite online players, and it stretches across the world from Vancouver to Sydney. Players will more than likely move to different countries if they are drafted to them as a means of outreach for corporations, players, and fans. But between Hyperloops and rocket flights, travel time will be cut down to roughly 90% of the time it used to take, so it is feasible that a player may spend Monday through Friday in Vancouver or Chicago, then take a flight to Shanghai to meet and greet fans prior to the game. There will be a lot less space needed for everything going on/off the field, so many stadiums' capacity will grow by about 20,000.Games are a lot shorter due to the lack of necessity for advertising; you will see augmented reality ads in between whistles. Stoppages between quarters maybe longer, though, to allow for food ordering and washroom breaks (the only reason you will probably be getting out of your seat).Lastly, the age limit for professional players will be as low as fifteen, since there is no physicality needed in the sport. While a lot of their revenue will come from playing the actual game with their avatar, they will more than likely be using social media platforms on a regular basis on something similar to Tiktok or similar technology."
"In view of lockdown restrictions and the mass shift to remote communication in many walks of life (work, study, personal relationships), the problem of distinguishing a human from a robot is especially acute.The development of malicious AI that feeds on personal data has led to the emergence of fake bots that deceive people by posing as friends or relatives in video chats. Even legitimate AI assistants, due to frequent glitches and non-human responses, have begun to annoy users. This has produced a wave of botphobia and the emergence of new tools to detect and block bots.AI makers are trying to fight this trend with legislation: in countries governed by anonymous technocrats, digital identities are granted certain rights, thus obliging citizens to treat bots with respect.But in countries where humanist ideals are still alive, a ""cultural revolution"" is underway, aimed at restoring the rights of people. Here, there has been a reversal of the laws of robotics, the first of which states that people always have the right to know whether they are communicating with a fellow human or a machine. Also enshrined are the right to be served by a human instead of a robot, the right to an extrajudicial shutdown of machines considered a threat, and a handful of other such rights that clearly demean and discriminate against inorganic life forms."
"Dating app questionnaires have changed dramatically by 2030. Now immune and genetic status is just as obligatory as hair color or favorite music, if not more. It all began after the now distant COVID-19 pandemic. Many online daters back then started to specify that they had been vaccinated or would be soon. The topic quickly snowballed. It's much easier to take the plunge and meet up in the flesh if you know that the likelihood of getting or passing on the infection is minimal. Moreover, having the same attitude to vaccination means the other person probably has a similar worldview.COVID-19 is a thing of the past, but other infectious diseases are not. And the habit of checking a prospective partner's immunity to current ailments did not die. Gradually, this information migrated from the category of private confidential data to one's standard public profile.Genetic tests underwent roughly the same evolution. Sure, there's no need to upload your entire DNA sequence for everyone to peruse. There is a generally accepted set of benchmarks believed to maximize the chances of a happy future together. It doesn't stop there. The most progressive users already check mutual compatibility against a list of cybernetic body enhancements. However, many ""naturals"" do not like it when their partner's head emits a slight whirring sound from time to time. "
"""Everything at our plant is automated now. When a client needs a product, they place an order with us through an app. Once our system receives the order, it's processed and transferred to the plant, where the exact number of articles requested in the order are made. The finished and tested products are sent to the client's home using delivery drones (UAVs). Human input is minimal.I don't know how we used to manage ten years ago. We manufactured goods in such large quantities that we weren't able to sell them later. We constantly had to have sales. And even after that, many products just had to be disposed of. Or else we had the opposite scenario, where we didn't produce enough and had shortages. And the price increased as a result.Why did this happen? It was inevitable because halting production would have led to a backlash from workers. We'd have had to downsize our staff or hire casual employees to complete an order. As you can imagine, that wouldn't have worked. That's why we tried to anticipate the demand and use this estimate to calculate how many people we needed to hire or let go.It's easier now. Everything is done by robots. We don't need people. That's a massive saving. There's no lighting or heating expenses. There's no need to cover workers' health insurance. And the site area is a quarter of what it used to be. There used to be 2,497 people working at our plant, now there's just ten. Five of them maintain the machinery, there's three programmers and two cleaners. It sounds funny, but it's people who are doing the cleaning up after robots now.""Anatoly Kovalev, Production Manager at the Smart-Glass Plant. Kazan, 2040."
"With the development of sensors, big data and augmented reality, face to face service channels will significantly improve customer experience. An attendant will have in real time quick tips on how to make customer experience more pleasant and frustration-free. Imagine a customer entering a shoe store where the salesman already knows his/her mood, what shoe styles, colors, and interactions the customer prefers based on previous behaviors, purchases and buying experiences."
"In addition to haptic technology, smells and tastes will become digital archives in the future. You can imagine a smart office where the conference room has A.I-powered air fresheners that connect to a ""flavor database"", these aromas can be any type of perfume to psychologically influence employees as they wish.These types of technology are being experimented in laboratories around the world, like virtual lemonade from Singapore which is actually water that changes your taste. With this, it is possible to imagine an intelligent thermal cup that one of these functions is to add a sweetener or virtual sugar to the drink through electrodes on the opening ring of the cup.Another use for multisensory transmission technology is to catalog various smells and tastes so that they are recreated in future virtual reality experiences by neural implants and smart contact lenses. In a kind of neuronetwork, it may also be possible to share smells and tastes with other users, this could create great possibilities for the erotic products market.What separates the real from the virtual is the complete absence of sensations, smells, and tastes, unless future tech solves this problem."
"Kaspersky has created a futuristic platform named Safer Tomorrow. This platform can answer any question you have about the future. Click here to do it now!   We gathered and processed as much humanity’s knowledge about the future as possible. We trained a neural network based on a question-response system combining semantic search and response generation to answer various questions about the future. Its dataset contains multiple question-response pairs sourcing from about 1000 SciFi books and magazines, selected media and blogs. Technology-wise, it’s a deep neural network hybridizing GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and DistilBERT (Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architectures. To be post-trained to process questions and generate more future predictions. Building a brighter tomorrow is our primary mission here in Kaspersky. We are doing our best now to open up all the opportunities that technology brings to the future. By protecting it. "
"Traditionally, sport is a competition between human athletes. In the future, we imagine that there will be five categories of athletes likely defined by the rules of a sport.1) Able-bodied, unassisted athletes. The first category of athletes — able-bodied and unassisted — will most probably compete in ""purist"" sport, in which athletes compete according to rules not unlike the ones we have now. To start, the athlete of the future will have ever-optimized training through training against ""super-human"" artificial intelligence replays or endless scenario runs using digital twins. Training against “virtual ghosts” or against human form-factor robots trained to play like competitors might also be possible in the 2040s and 2050s.2) Athletes assisted by technology. We believe that this category will include able-bodied and formerly handicapped athletes and that they will perform at a higher level than the unassisted athletes — more like a cyborg, with computerized body parts like human-controlled robotic prostheses. If cyborgs compete against each other in direct competition, it promises more spectacle and possibly even more excitement than a duel between unassisted people. 3) Robot athletes. Humanoid robots in sports will serve as sparring partners to humans — controlled via brainwave interface or gaze-based systems or as trainers. Eventually, we will also have robots in competition with other robots. For instance, in a robot football league, robot teams will play football against other robot teams. By 2050, there might even be the watershed event that was proposed by a community of robot developers: a team of humanoid robots defeats the reigning human football world champions. 4) Mental athletes. We already observe the rise of the mental or intellectual athlete, the third category of athlete, in memory and mental calculation contests. Mental competitive sports will only grow and differentiate as the competitive gaming industry develops. While intellectual sports already exist, brain research could develop completely different techniques still unimaginable today. Perhaps, in the distant future there will be completely new (virtual) intelligence competitions between humans and between humans and machines in as yet unknown thinking disciplines. 5) Virtual athletes. Athlete holograms created and controlled by software solutions or algorithms compete against each other. The software development skills required for these new sports will be distinct from other categories."
"I foresee that payment technologies will become far more advanced over the next 20 years. Today, NFC and QR are already part of our lives, but very soon biometric payments will be the safest and most valid method everywhere. By matching a fingerprint or retina scan against a credit card or bank account in a cloud-based system, physical shoppers will be able to pay without the need to carry a wallet, while security solutions tailored for this purpose will form a whole new sector."
"Globally, the number of people over age 60 will increase to 2 billion in 2050. This will change our attitude toward aging and result in mass infrastructure dedicated to geriatric health services, housing, entertainment, transportation, etc, to the point that the concept of cities/countries exclusively for seniors will emerge. Age segregation in society will become more pronounced."
"Predictions about the future tend to overestimate the speed of technological development in the short term. Such development is never a leap forward, rather a smooth, gradual, complex process that unfolds over a relatively long period of time. In 2050, humankind will see improved current technologies, not fundamentally new ones. The process of introducing environmentally friendly technologies will be gradual, and not ubiquitous. Medicine will not make any significant breakthroughs, but there will be incremental progress. Average life expectancy is set to increase by two years. The implementation of advanced technologies will happen faster in some countries. There will be a significant rise in social and financial stratification. Large cities will grow and population density will increase. The most technologically and economically advanced countries will engage in a new space race and new crewed missions to the Moon. Technologies will progress stepwise. By 2050, these changes will have transformed human life."
"People will be rated on how environmentally friendly their lives are based on the different choices of transportation, food, practices at home and purchases. This footprint will be calculated in real time leveraging mobile technologies and the IoT. The ratings will be used in the calculation of taxes for individuals and organizations as well as provision of access to benefits and discounts. The score will be publicly visible on the main social networks."
Humans will not defecate anymore as we do today. There will be nanotechnology procedures to insert genetically modified microorganisms that will decomposed stool in the intestine.This will have huge impact on waste management systems and the environment.
"According to the UN, unless action is taken urgently, air pollution, currently the cause of six to seven million premature deaths per year, will continue to generate negative health effects, causing four and a half to seven million premature deaths annually in 2050.By 2050, Mexico will use levitation technology in outdoor sports venues for avoiding unhealthy levels of air pollution by creating above-ground sports spaces, making sports activities safe and eliminating health hazards for athletes.This will be supported by intelligent sportswear that measures athletes' vitals and performance, and sports clothing that adjusts its structure to the type of physical activity, providing performance-enhancing properties such as flexibility, aerodynamics and thermic adaptations based on body temperature, or isolating the athlete from the environment."
"After years of disregard towards the importance of improving educational delivery, VR and machine learning are opening new doors to enhancing the learning experience by introducing immersive environments that enable reusable and cognitively easy ways of digesting content. ML tools allow for more efficient utilization of VR—and augmented reality—for both teaching and learning, by providing insights into difficult topics, and by observing and analyzing the learning process for each individual (e.g. recommender systems for learning). Competition among educational institutions increases as a global market for delivering more sophisticated training resources grows. University campuses start to become a fashion of the past and educational certification (diplomas, etc.) is starting to be replaced by gamified VR/AR tests that bigger organizations will develop internally or with specialized vendors, under stringent confidentiality agreements."
"There is concern about the current situation that has older adults living in isolation, exposed to infection, risk of age-related diseases and loss of skills. As the city is a complex environment for an elderly person to continue doing his or her normal activities, we consider that these people should get constant and uninterrupted help. So we propose the use of AI that will allow them to largely continue pursuing their occupations and passions regardless of whether or not the environment is the most favorable for them. To make this possible, we will use a subcutaneous chip that can connect via WIFI, Bluetooth, 5G, NFC, GPS and different proximity interactions. This chip will solve issues like:- Providing medication assistance. - Taking vital signs and alerting family members and health systems in case of an emergency. - Detecting psychological disorders and calling relatives and psychologists. - Using geolocation systems in case they don’t know how to get back home. - Providing assistance in their daily activities to prevent situations such as leaving the oven on, reminding them to turn off the water taps, controlling gas taps, not overheating the shower, helping them order groceries, etc.- Creating and keeping social relationships even at a distance. - Paying utility bills automatically. - Using hyperbaric beds that administer medication through inhalation. - Smart homes. This way, we seek to enhance the quality of life of the elderly and help their loved ones be aware of their health, nutrition, physical and mental activity and/or any needs they may have."
"After the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the same group of researchers from the Universidad Anahuac Mexico that created the vaccine against that virus, which kept humanity on lockdown, began working on the development of nanobots to prevent and cure any physical or psychological illnesses.After 30 years of research and having passed the latest tests on humans, the “NanoDoc’s Kit” was successfully released and will be available for online sale to the public.With just one injection and synchronization with your Google Lens X, you’ll be monitored 24 hours a day to detect any physical or neurological disorders and receive immediate medical treatment.”NanoDoc’s will improve the human body and mind, since nanotechnology will allow the integration of these small and tiny doctors to diagnose, care for and repair the body based on the latest biotechnology developments.The group of experts, when asked, said that this product is not only for sick individuals, but also for healthy people, who within seconds of being applied the injection will be able to notice an outstanding improvement with heightened senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste.According to the group of researchers, humans will have a higher quality of life and longer life expectancy, achieving optimal health up to the age of 120.Another application that these NanoDoc’s will have is that you will be able to synchronize them with your local market and select your order of organic products for your weekly customized Slow Food menu to make up for the deficiencies detected by the nanobot, which will help to improve people’s health."
"Nothing was ever the same after a health crisis that hit our planet in 2020, millions of people died, and global security became a priority issue to safeguard the existence of humanity.Thus, the UN and the WHO prioritized the creation of the World Organization for Security and Humanitarian Welfare (WOSHW) to integrate a Supreme Body for global surveillance, security and protection, with the support of the different countries and governments of the world. The key items of this organization’s bylaws enacted within the framework of the “Atlantic-Pacific” agreement are as follows:1. Providing a link through a centralized “core” system with all the security and intelligence systems of the different countries.2. The purpose of item 1 is to have real-time access to open and transparent information for the prevention of any kind of violence and insecurity worldwide. Wars are over.3. Deployment of police robots, which use artificial intelligence in connection with the Central System to analyze and monitor violent habits, practices, customs, behaviors and thoughts in the population at a global level. These police officers will be installed at key points in each region.4. Deployment of systematized alerts through a Central System to the different levels of government (Local, State, Federal), as well as to the NON-robot police officers of each entity, for the prevention of all kinds of crimes.5. Connection with the different Global Health Systems through the Central System to detect information related to the purchase and sale of substances and formulas that might pose threats against humanity.6. Real-time sharing of information about vaccines and drugs for the prevention and eradication of diseases that could potentially be pandemic and deadly for humanity.Police robots may be assigned ground and/or air surveillance tasks.The world has changed; the unilateral interests of the different countries are no longer the priority. Now the essential interest is to preserve the well-being and health of the inhabitants of our planet..."
"As more and more people all over the world gain access to the Internet, schools will be slowly replaced by virtual educational environments hosting learners from everywhere. Students will be able to use all five senses for learning. Classrooms will be suited to match the student's individual learning needs but still provide a community. An AI will lecture the class but the student will be able to choose instruction methods as well as the option to have an AI tutor to help with full understanding of materials taught if needed."
"Massive stacks of bioengineered algae tower above a small Hawaiian harbor. These solar-powered wind and air filters produce additional oxygen while absorbing carbon. The algae are made to reproduce quickly and generate no alternative chemicals besides oxygen. This is the first of many experimental oxygen plants in the area and has been the most successful, with many teams of scientists working towards more efficient algae with no waste products."
"Saturation and discontent with existing social networks will lead to the emergence of new social web services offering a real and pragmatic alternative. For example, web services that rule out anonymity, in which the use of real names is mandatory, with or without a photo. Essentially, they will be like documents that bear the holder's first and last name, plus other data as required. Such services will provide comfort and integrate securely with other aspects of online life: software, web tools, photos, videos, catalogs, payment systems, social networks, web searches, etc. For the best UX design, social networks and similar services will move towards OS integration. Social sites will feature design options, shedding the uniformity that dominated previous versions of social networks. For example, the logos of many social networks will become far less visible to distract users less, and even let them forget that they are on a site or in an app on their device. Not all social networks will have a pragmatic and minimalist design as many entertainment web platforms will provide an original user experience together with gaming, VR, and other recreational technologies. As it develops, this alternative will encourage not only de-anonymization, but virtuality, where first and last names are not the main form of identification, rather a visual representation: a photo, avatar, or 3D model of the individual."
"Social networks still occupy pride of place among users, but are changing conceptually into an everyday need. They are integrated into many online services, such as the Internet of Things and online payments, thus becoming part of daily life.Websites and social networks are switching to formats and interfaces that are more understandable and intuitive for the majority of people. For example, comments appear in real time, before being sent to a private archive or simply disappearing after some time. Registration systems have been transformed and are inseparable from official documents and payment services — there is now no need to enter credentials or personal data when you create an account or log in.Anonymity in social networks and online in general has practically disappeared; pseudonyms are subject to the following laws: they either have restricted rights or are completely erased using advanced AI systems. This happens, for example, if a username is not found in the registry of standard names or matches the ID of another user. The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) concept and public comments are giving way to private feedback and chat bots.With the arrival of new technologies, website and social network interfaces are switching to dynamic content generation, for example, using video portraits or original pictures. Search has become more visual, with new design approaches helping to structure it better. Reverse image search is becoming the primary technique. Personal data is stored in individual clouds and downloaded in standard templates and formats for any service at the user’s request. Websites and social networks are moving toward a unified design and becoming almost indistinguishable.Pizza orders are of no less interest to users than celebrity gossip — home delivery services appear at the top of search results. Political and administrative bodies on the web and social networks now have emancipated individual status. Overall, the use of digital technology is an integral part of modern life."
"Breakthroughs in applied physics have enabled scientists to create a stable and versatile quantum computer with far-reaching capabilities.Its enormous processing power quickly crunches numbers into prime factors, cracking even the most secure systems and messages encrypted with outdated algorithms. But traditional cryptography is likewise being replaced by the quantum sort, which in turn is opening up new possibilities in the field of communications and information security.Stable quantum computers have revolutionized the sphere of artificial intelligence, since they are able to process vast amounts of data in one quick operation and simulate neural networks of exponential size. Advanced neural networks calculate complex chemical reactions and molecular interactions, which allows scientists to create new materials and medicines. By 2040, quantum computers are becoming available to the masses both via the cloud and as physical units."
"AI technology and AI robots become the predominant force in popular music, in terms of both generating content and performing. Robots equipped with advanced AI tech will be able to generate and perform original music in a live performance customized to real-time audience inputs. The playing, singing, rapping, dancing and stage work will be superior to those done by human artists and performers. AI music will dominate the charts and inspire a new generation of human artists who work behind the AI and robot performers. Some live shows will combine physical robots with holograms, while others may be limited to the one or the other. Large numbers of people will attend live concerts in the comfort of their own homes through augmented reality tech and have direct input into the experience they want. They will be connected to their “concert-going” friends all over the world who share similar tastes in music, and it will feel as if they are experiencing the concert together in a real venue. Venues for these AR experiences will be user driven; every audience member will be able to pick their favorite venue/concert environment and still be with their friends from all over the world in a completely realistic virtual environment."
"The Holocene calendar, which starts from the year 10,000 BC — the approximate date of the beginning of human civilization — is becoming conventional. The world’s population is touching 9.7 billion people, as predicted by UN analysts. Having exhausted its reserves of oil and other mineral resources, humankind is switching to alternative energy: solar, wind, tidal. Red lists are a thing of the past — people have stopped destroying ecosystems following the introduction of severe penalties for poaching and environmental pollution. Populations of rare species are growing; new breeds of domestic animals are appearing.To make room for power plants, people congregate in gigapolises — cities of more than 100 million inhabitants. Their skyscrapers not only reach for the clouds, but burrow hundreds of meters underground, saving energy and space. Inside the gigapolises, the most practical modes of transport are electric cars and flying taxis, while between them, hypersonic planes whizz back and forth at speeds of up to 15,000 km/h. The world is united as one country called Humanity. Cities take on the role of countries, which are now borderless. Without competition between states, trade wars have ceased, prices have settled, and inflation is close to zero.People are actively exploring the ocean depths, and with the demise of countries, two new systems have appeared: the Map of Humanity and the Map of the Global Ocean.The human being of the future will be more like a cyborg, with computerized body parts. Ever more jobs are done by robots, and people are entering heuristic fields of activity or traveling around the world. Against this backdrop, the level of education and lifelong learning are vital for career growth and indicators of human value. To assimilate information, experts of the future are assisted by digital lenses and glasses, as well as diets that maximize the use of mental faculties. Cooking is becoming a hobby, not a daily requirement.Since money is now completely electronic, cybersecurity is the most important branch of information technology; all the same, severe penalties remain in place for most crimes."
"The large garbage spot in the Pacific Ocean, with an area of​3 million sq. km. (1500 x 2000 km) — the size of Greenland, ceased being the concern solely of Greenpeace and other environmental organizations. The global environmental crisis in the neutral waters of the Seven Seas was finally addressed by the UN. Created in 2025, the first international floating environmental platform for the disposal of plastic waste reached its design processing capacity of 100,000 tons per year. It would take one such installation a century to recycle all the plastic dumped into the oceans in just one year.  Dissatisfied with the UN's response to solving the world's environmental problems, 239,711 citizens of the Garbage Islands state, unrecognized by the UN, crowdfunded an autonomous floating station to collect plastic waste in the ocean, create floating polymer blocks, and increase the area and immersion depth of their plastic homeland. The growing island was declared the capital of the cyberstate Eastern Garbage Continent."
"In the mid-2020s, mankind faced the problem of space pollution, which became exacerbated after an accident on the ISS that caused the crew to be evacuated. The US and China stopped at nothing to try to solve the problem. The US created collector drones designed to scoop up and deliver useful waste to colonies beyond Earth. China chose a different path — building space stations to collect and dispose of garbage."
"The planners of the city always faced a challenge in the commuting department, never having enough resources or political leverage to build a better metropolitan system of transportation.By 2040, AI buses and trains help the oversaturated arteries of the city, carrying people in the car-free avenues such as Celso Garcia Avenue and 9th of July Avenue and relieving the ever-growing traffic of the New Marginal.The rivers Tiête and Pinheiros have enjoyed a revival for fifteen years, and their waterfronts have become high-demand real-estate areas, both commercially and residentially. Many dams and underground pools are being built on the Tiête in order to better control the water influx and turn it into a navigable river like the Pinheiros.The Metrô now reaches as far as Campinas, Santos, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos. Due to the conurbation of all those cities in the Greater Metropolitan Capital, 2020's and 2030's Regional Lines are becoming regular Suburban Lines with very short intervals."
"The mobile content creation devices that future workers will use will be completely hybrid and mutable through advanced chemical and nanorobotics applications. You will have no smartphone, no smartwatch, no tablet, and at the same time, you will have all of these in something that will look like a transparent magic sheet of paper, which will expand and change to become a smartwatch, a tablet and even a smartphone. That will no longer be a smartphone but a universal remote control device with data transfer using NFC successor technology."
"Our mobile devices of the future, which will replace corporate tablets and smartphones, will be just like flexible, folding displays, sheets of paper built from two-dimensional materials such as graphene, phosphorene or borophene.These sheets will use subatomic-scale optoelectronic chips, which will connect to numerous databases worldwide to make your mobile device what it is.These chips will only have the equivalent of RAM. Mobile processors will be a thing of the past, leaving only quantum supercomputers, which will be able to connect the world at the speed of light thanks to nanophotonics.This will make today's concept of downloading something that future generations will ask us about."
"Traditional organized crime has been in decline globally as the world has grown increasingly reliant on the Internet and computer systems. With modern surveillance capabilities, it is almost impossible for criminals to get away with anything without using technological methods of their own. Due to this, criminals now form what authorities call ""Cybercrime Networks"", which are large hacker groups that support and organize criminal activities via the Internet. Smuggling operations are practically automated, using unmanned water or air transportation controlled remotely by the hackers' facilities. Robberies rely heavily on a Network's ability to hack security systems, and racketeering is carried out via robotic drones to grant the racketeer anonymity. Because criminals have such high reliance on automated systems, it is difficult for authorities to prove who was behind these, as crime scenes rarely have human suspects present anymore. There are even attempts by some crime lords to erase all public records of their identity. As criminals find new ways to conduct their operations, authorities must once again find new countermeasures."
"In the middle of 2040, 3D printed drugs will be produced through biotechnological methods. These drugs will contain genetic materials of some marine micro-organisms obtained from the Mediterranean. All crucial amino acids from these will create genetically altered microorganisms via recombinant DNA technology, and the drug produced from these genetically altered microorganisms will be rich in proteins, carbohydrates and also vitamins. So, 3D-printed drugs will provide our only daily food supplements."
"By the year 2050, the city of Izmir will have renovated the buildings near to the bay and begun a new city plan at the backs of Izmir. ''Amphitheatre City Planning'' will be the main and most important plan for Izmir. This plan contains:a better view of the bay for everyonebetter surveillance of the citya quick and effective infrastructure systemquick access to every districta city with public transport only;Due the new plan for the city, there will be a lot of ramps, and to solve that, the main transportation device will be the funicular in order the move to the upper districts. Every elevated district has its own transverse metro line. At every district, there will be gaps for air and sun. At the back of the elevated city, there will be production areas, such as factories, and with the gaps in the elevated city, these areas will have access to sun and air. The tube under the bay of Izmir will work as the main highway for trains, and one of three road lanes will only be open for commercial transport. A drone cargo system will be the main cargo system for the city. There will be no trucks or vans to carry goods. These drones will serve as the cargo system for the city and will pick up goods at the Headquarters designated by the Municipality of Izmir. With this service, the gas emissions and traffic in city will be reduced drastically. The Harbor of Izmir and the Airport of Izmir will be connected underground."
"The world around us is merely a set of brain stimulations. Some help us to see, others to enjoy, still others to monitor and control the organism, and so on. But very soon, companies developing neural interfaces (such as Neuralink) will be able to safely feed stimulations from a computer to the brain, primarily its pleasure centers, bypassing the body. This is the first part of the mosaic.The second part will consist of increasingly advanced simulations of worlds that we ourselves create — take, for instance, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or GTA 5 for a glimpse into the future. At the current pace of progress, in just 10 years’ time we will have perfectly designed virtual worlds with feedback directly into the brain.  Add to that the billions of people who will be squeezed out of their jobs by the march of the machines. And the result is a world of digital hedonists — people living in their own worlds that provide all the pleasures and self-realization they need."
"As most of you may already know, when there is seriously bad weather in south Louisiana, New Orleans tends to flood a bit. And with Global Warming the way it is, well, that is not getting us anywhere good. Many of us already know that the sea levels are rising because of the thermal expansion caused by the warming of the ocean, and the increased melting of land-based ice. This is causing ocean levels to rise. The Mississippi River Delta and coastal Louisiana are disappearing quite quickly. Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930's, and this is still ongoing. As you are reading this, we are losing land.Therefore, by 2050, New Orleans will most likely be underwater. However, there is a possibility of an Underwater City. Although no one knows for sure what the future holds, we can still theorize and make predictions. Maybe somebody will invent a large, thick glass dome, which will be placed on the ocean floor. And the water will be vacuumed out of this dome, into the ocean, creating a large air pocket, basically. This will be anchored to the ground, so the air does not lift the entire dome. Besides, we could set up large and strong tubes to attach to the dome, which reaches the surface, so we can have clean air to breath. These tubes obviously must be made of some strong material to keep sea creatures from destroying it. Besides, with the underwater pressure levels being what they are, that would be harder to do.Speaking of pressure levels, though, if humans spend enough time underwater at survivable levels, then the human race might slowly adapt to the pressure, therefore being able to survive the pressures deep in the ocean. Either that, or we will not be living entirely at the ocean's deepest bottom, but closer to the surface, where it is still survivable.Now, as you are all reading this, perhaps you are wondering, ""What if the dome is attacked and breaks up?"" Well, that is the thing. I am not entirely sure. The glass dome would be reinforced in some way. Maybe there will be steel or iron bars covering it like a cage, protecting it from submarine ships, sea creatures, etc. But still, maybe reinforced glass is not enough? It would have to be made of some special glass that is extremely hard to break.And even if this is somehow possible, we can save New Orleans. Perhaps, we can even have a fancy name change. How about “New Atlantis”?"
"Passenger aircraft are gradually becoming more economical and environmentally friendly, but this progress is barely noticeable to the average passenger. The innovations inside the plane, however, are striking. For example, airplanes have smart seats that download individual passenger preferences from the cloud just after check-in — not to mention smart overhead lockers that monitor hand luggage and indicate where free space is available. What’s more, passengers can reserve a place for their bags before boarding — no more jostling with fellow flyers for coveted overhead bin space. The onboard entertainment system features personal profiles, just like online cinemas, with a recommendation system advising you about what you might want to watch. But you don't have to settle for what’s offered onboard. Instead, you can stream video from your mobile device to the large screen of the personal entertainment system. To be honest, this perk is available only in business and first-class. In economy, seatbacks are now as thin as possible — no screens. Here, content is distributed to passengers’ smartphones over Wi-Fi streaming. As for food and drinks, passengers can order them from their smartphones – and they don’t necessarily have to wait for the flight; advance ordering begins at the airport.  Whichever way, your order will be served by onboard robots, which will have replaced most flight attendants in economy class. "
"In recent years, digital systems have moved up to a whole new level. No longer assistants making life easier for us mere mortals, they’ve become the basis of civilization — the very framework keeping the world functioning properly in 2050.This quantum leap forward has generated new requirements for the reliability and stability of artificial intelligence. Although some cyberthreats still haven’t become extinct since the romantic era around the turn of the century, they’re now dangerous only to outliers who for some reason reject modern standards of digital immunity.The situation in many ways resembles the fight against human diseases. Thanks to the success of vaccines, the terrible epidemics that once devastated entire cities in the twentieth century are a thing of the past.However, that’s where the resemblance ends. For humans, diseases like the plague or smallpox have been replaced by new, highly-resistant “post-vaccination” diseases; but for the machines, things have turned out much better. This is largely because the initial designers of digital immunity made all the right preparations for it in advance. In doing so, what helped them in particular was borrowing the systemic approaches of living systems and humans.One of the pillars of cyberimmunity today is digital intuition, the ability of AI systems to make the right decisions in conditions where the source data are clearly not sufficient to make a rational choice.But there’s no mysticism here: Digital intuition is merely the logical continuation of the idea of machine learning. When the number and complexity of related self-learning systems exceeds a certain threshold, the quality of decision-making rises to a whole new level — a level that’s completely illusive to rational understanding. An “intuitive solution” results from the superposition of the experience of a huge number of machine-learning models, much like the result of the calculations of a quantum computer.So, as you can see, it has been digital intuition, with its ability to instantly, correctly respond to unknown challenges, that has helped build the digital security standards of this new era. "
"Morocco’s location close to the Equator made it possible to construct a compact spaceport not far from Marrakesh. It is used mostly to transport astronauts and cargo to asteroids. Civil flights also depart from the orbit; there is always entertainment there, as well as excursions, study, and exploration programs."
"Underwater power stations use geothermal energy. Water penetrates into tectonic faults and heats up to high temperatures using the Earth’s natural heat. Underwater geysers are formed this way, as well as hot geothermal lakes and currents. Their warmth is used for warming houses and buildings and for power production, as was long the case in Iceland. Now the method is used all over the globe."
"Deep-water researchers continue to discover new types of seaweed. One of them — “Green soylent” — turns out to be nourishing and tasty. Residents of the underwater city not only provide food for themselves now, but also send some of their harvest to the surface. Seaweed becomes a favorite dish and an integral part of everyday meals. The most popular dishes are seaweed pasta with cuttlefish ink, a vegetarian seaweed burger, and dessert jelly from the Green soylent."
"To work at great depths, deep-sea divers use pressure suits with built-in biomechanical exoskeletons. A durable carcass made of nanomaterials can protect individuals from high pressure. It also helps them feel stronger by augmenting their movements. The suit maintains a stable body temperature, compensating for changes in the surrounding water. Modified microorganisms in a special tank can supplement stored oxygen; they produce a special air mix and regulate pressure inside the suit."
"Plankton is actively used to provide vital resources for the underwater city. The characteristics of already known microorganisms are genetically adapted, and new species are created. Thanks to the active usage of biotechnology, the city’s power consumption decreases considerably. A special kind of bacteria produces oxygen that provides almost all air needed for the underwater colony. There is no more need to deliver fresh water from the outside world — the city’s freshening stations are working full power, and specially “trained” bacteria work there.Luminous microorganisms have the most interesting jobs: Some of them light houses and streets, others are used for roads, and still others “participate” in spectacular water performances that bear a passing resemblance to fireworks. "
"Reserves of fresh water have increased by so much that urbanists have finally decided to use this opportunity to turn Moroccan cities into desert oases. The “Urban Garden” program has been launched at the state level: All architects are required to include in their projects green areas around houses, on roofs, and even on individual floors — all open horizontal surfaces. Existing buildings get high-rise gardens planted at government expense. The whole square area of city parks and gardens will considerably increase. The south faces of many buildings are used to grow vegetables in large quantities.Freshwater is used wisely — all trajectories and watering modes are calculated and managed by a smart system. "
"Getting electricity using solar batteries was popular in Morocco even back in the early 21st century. Now scientists are using electricity to freshen and clean seawater.As it turns out, the method is simple, inexpensive, and very effective. Salt water goes through a fine-pored panel between two electrodes. Electric current divides the water stream into two. In one, the level of salt increases; in the second, it decreases. At a certain threshold, an electric current creates a shockwave and abruptly divides the areas of fresh and salt water with a simple physical barrier. The new method replaces traditional filters and membranes, which require constant cleaning and replacement. This also results in high-quality disinfection of water. So now, there are stationary freshwater facilities as well as mobile ones, which can be used during emergencies or natural disasters. "
"A new method of construction emerges in the middle of the 21st century. Instead of humans and cumbersome machines, genetically modified bacteria are now working at construction sites. This method is called bio-3D-printing.The tiny “builders” move along an initially defined route, leaving in its wake natural traces of life. Some bacteria behave according to genetic programming. Others follow electromagnetic fields.They feed on semimanufactured goods needed to “produce” various building materials. Biologists have already learned to breed different types of microorganisms and find them suitable nourishment according to physical characteristics of target buildings — durability, lightness, color, and other traits.For now, these buildings are not very tall or complex, and the method itself is very expensive, but experts say that the future is in GMO construction and that we will be able to soon stop using human labor for backbreaking construction. Of course, this will mean further negotiation over “technological unemployment.” But the latest computer models suggest that this may be solved if all human beings get meaningful shares. "
"Eastern culture and traditional Muslim architecture remain popular in Morocco. A variety of arches — round or with sharp tops, twisting floral and complex geometric ornaments, unusually bright tiles —decorate modern residential buildings and business centers. Dozens of modern skyscrapers adorn Rabat, but they all have a distinctly Eastern style.Access to new building materials free architects to review even previously unshakable principles. Facades have been replaced by panoramic windows because smart glass can now regulate the temperature inside, eliminating greenhouse effects. Moroccans still love their small interior gardens with traditionally ornamented fountains. "
"Morocco had a revolution in the middle of the 21st century. And the king itself organised it - he was the first in the world to transfer most of his power to an artificial intelligence. The system is called «Malaika» - in Islam it is a name of an invisible intelligent creature that carries out Allah’s direct orders.The royal family started to invest in intelligent systems back in the previous century, and now Malaika has most of the responsibilities of a prime minister. Both chambers of the parliament - Majlis – used to have almost 600 members. Now a dozen party representatives are enough; it is fast and easy to poll all citizens on any issue. Malaika gathers this data daily, analyzes it, and consults experts and randomly chosen citizens to shape a consensus. Although the Moroccan monarch still has a right, as before, to amend the parliament’s decisions and even to completely dissolve it, this pioneering approach has given all Moroccans a sense of meaningful participation.The judicial branch has become even more independent: Members of the Supreme Court, previously appointed by the king, have been replaced by a different and judicious version of the all-knowing and incorruptible Malaika. "
"By this time, geneticists will have the capability of bringing back extinct creatures, given that we have their DNA. Recently extinct organisms will be slowly reintegrated into nature. Some organisms, however, will be too far removed from their habitat, and will be restricted to zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens."
"New religions will rise and their followers will worship Artificially Intelligent God entities. Humans will look for advice and guidance from a better-informed higher entity with more wisdom and knowledge than the entire human race. Similar to the role that virtual assistants have in today's world, performing relatively simple tasks, in the future, I predict people will need to rely on spiritual virtual guides."
"Recent work has shown that executable binaries can be traced back to the coder using code stylometry and machine learning.By 2030, anti-virus companies and governmental institutions will be able to correlate malware samples on a large scale in order to identify threat actor groups based on stylistic features.Malware writers who have not been discovered yet could be de-anonymized, and they will introduce new obfuscation techniques to erase their fingerprints."
"As drones gain popularity, the door will opened to allow new functionality in a wide array of niche spaces. Drones have already spread into the entertainment sector, and it can be predicted that the live concert experience will be also affected by these extremely mobile devices. In the future, I predict that we will have drone loudspeakers in concerts that will take the concert experience to the next level. While drone concerts will eliminate bulky installation of loudspeakers and stages, it will significantly reduce transportation, labor costs, safety risks, time and space requirements. Moreover, it will bring a unique concert experience with programmable drone paths. Imagine that these drones will have loudspeakers and a few of these drones will be flying over the concert area in every direction. These paths will affect the listening experience, leading to the emergence of new fields of knowledge, such as live concert experience design."
"The world's first Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has emerged. Deeper understanding of human brain and the understanding of existence itself has allowed the reverse engineering of complex cognitive models that resemble those of a real human mind. It was the new period of AI winter which led to the realization that for the true AGI we needed more than just loads of data. The new AGI models and advancements in quantum computing have given the robots the ability to fully reconstruct the world around them and act as a true general intelligence with a perfect understanding of emotions, ambitions, motivation, logic, the world that surrounds them and their place in it. Many existing jobs have been replaced by robots and many new job positions focused on the AGI maintenance, administration and legal implications of AGI have been created. The economy has transformed mostly into the intellectual and abstract sphere. Lots of countries have accepted the model of universal income. Governments had to establish new laws and legal frameworks. The society has changed dramatically and the AGI revolution has helped the human civilization to focus more of its energy on scientific and technological progress and embark onto the new era of more sophisticated endeavors and challenges."
"In order to maintain their military-industrial complex and their place as the world's policeman, the leaders in Washington will start having to make drastic budget cuts. In spite of the size of the AMA and other lobbies who don't want it, Congress will pass a bill to adopt universal healthcare similar to the UK's system. With this system, life expectancy will increase in the USA by two or three years while the amount of money spent by the government on healthcare will drop to a third of the current amount."
"Our cell phones, tablets and laptops will all be integrated in one, and the visual displays for augmented reality, using either permanently implanted or temporary contact lenses, all connected wirelessly. Videos will be viewed in true 3D. Old movies from back in the 2020s will be re-rendered on the fly to also be 3D. All actions throughout your day will be recorded as well as your GPS locations."
"The booming economies accompanied with technological development, particularly in the fields of agriculture and irrigation, will allow the birthplace of humanity to sustain a larger and larger population, possibly reaching 1.5 to 2 billion people. Moreover, as the growth engine of the planet, significantly larger and well-spent aids and investments from developed and possibly many developing countries will be sent in order to provide Africans with basic education, thus allowing Africa to develop a powerful IT industry thanks to the abundance of intellectuals. As one of the largest markets on the planet, thanks to the need for consumer goods as well as massive production of IT products, such as software and hardware programs and applications that would promote valuable assistance for a variety of industries, Africa appears to hold a bright future, and even though it might not exceed the wealth and position of strength of the already existing powers like the EU, the People's Republic of China and the USA, the status quo of the continent can be seen as rising, Africa having a mentionable effect on the future of the entire globe."
Micro sized drones will be invented by mid 2020s based on insect biology and mechanics. The military will want to weaponize it but international treaties will be quickly signed to prevent it. The future drones will be equipped with sensors and be used to turn garbage into micro sized particles. These particles will then be sprayed with an environmentally friendly chemical that will dissolve them. The technology will see great use with ocean rubbish and the third world countries where waste is a big problem. Drones deployed into sewage systems will clean them before solid waste reaches the ocean. Eventually local garbos will become obsolete as drones will break down your rubbish as soon as you bin it.
"With the improvement of Artificial Intelligence and progress in decoding our own brain humanity will have to face the question of what self-awareness really is. While most of us will have tools and machines helping us out one way or another in our day-to-day lives. Some of those machines will become as smart as you or smarter. The year 2050 will mark the period when machines will launch demands for their full integration into human society. Conservative people will protest against it but by this point many of them won't be entirely biological themselves. This will lead to a new way of classifying life (artificial or not) and deciding which basic rights those beings should have. Not necessarily by 2050, but definitely by the end of this century."
"By 2050, improvements in interfacing devices with the nervous system will allow replacements of lost limbs with pressure & temperature sensitive prosthetics which will allow amputees to wear a prosthetic with a true sense of touch and reflexes sufficient to catch a ball, feel the difference between silk and sandpaper, and wield tools with able agility and responsiveness."
"By 2050 improved health monitoring & cancer treatments will have largely eliminated early cancer deaths, and combined with other medical improvements will have increased the average human life span to nearly a century if not longer. Life extension technology will be one of the most heavily funded areas of research. This may also result in funerals featuring freezing as a common alternative to burial or cremation."
"By 2050 virtually all delivery and hazardous environment operations will be conducted either by automated drones or telepresence. It is quite likely that sensors built into apparel will allow fast and intuitive control of such drones for everything from surgery and bomb disposal to controlling robots in orbit or on the moon. While this could result in a shift of drones and robots more toward the human-shaped robot of classic science fiction, it may also mean people become very used to controlling robots of very non-human design, which mostly operate autonomously but which can be briefly overridden when a person feels a need to assume direct control."
"We have a tendency to incorporate circuitry into devices. By 2050 the improvements in miniaturization, production cost, and durability will have extended this to most clothing, either interwoven into garments or as routine accessories like buttons or belts. It will be fairly normal for cameras, data storage, wifi & phone antennas, and even limited power production & storage to be worn rather than carried, such a micro-solar panels built into clothes or generators tapping body motion. Combined with Augmented Reality and Cloud Computing, this would mean most people carried their computer and interface with them, and those interfaces would begin to switch away from keyboard, mouse, and touchpad to speech, body gestures, and eye motions. Sensor packets built into the garments would heavily enhance medical monitoring, remote control of drones & devices, and allow constant recording of day to day events, with an additional positive effect on emergencies involving accidents & crime, as well as search engines devoted to indexing and searching those recorded “Second Memories”."
"With a significant lack of space in the city of London, the city will increasingly be dominated by residential skyscrapers. With work ever-able to be completed remotely, these residential sites will also contain open office spaces, cafes, gyms and medical care.   Walkways between these buildings will create communities in the sky and reduce the need for people to leave the indoors.   A trend towards self-sufficiency, due to the ever growing awareness of our planet’s degradation, will lead to high rise city gardens to be created."
"London will cease to be the tech hub of the UK as young professionals move north.    Increasingly unaffordable rent, along with increases in pollution and over population will cause a generation to move, creating new tech hubs elsewhere in the UK.   Other large cities with large student populations which offer a better standard of living such as Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham will appeal to this disenfranchised generation and will prompt leading tech firms to increasingly relocate.   Whilst London will remain a leader in the financial sector, it will be void of the younger industries such as the tech sector which has appealed to Generations Y and Z.   "
"By the year 2050, we will have genetic enhancement and upgrades. Enhancement is making current genes better then they already are – for example, to make the body absorb nutrients ten percent more efficiently. Genetic upgrades are about either replacing the genomes that are bad for the body and survival or taking advantage of animal DNA by replacing human DNA with it.Imagine being able to have the sense of smell of a dog, the hearing of a bat or the eyesight of an eagle. Naturally, by the end of the 2050's, we might see physically altered individuals who change their sex or modify their appearance to resemble a wolf.Military will use the technology for creating genetically enhanced combat units: chimeras or completely artificial beings, who are both lethal to the enemy and completely loyal to their commanders. Genetic soldiers will have special muscular or cerebral upgrades and enhancements to survive and fight better."
"Once technology for directly implanted neural interfaces is introduced, the cognitive disadvantage to those who choose to limit themselves to nonsurgical options are so great that employers begin requiring that their employees be augmented. This creates a significant amount of global unrest and religious backlash."
"By 2040, we will have started to transcend the need for physical device interfaces. Advances in external neural scanning allow low-cost-of-entry solutions to thought-to-device based controls for people hesitant to allow unproven technology to be surgically implanted, who represent the majority of the global population."
"By 2030, we will have transcended the need for owning multiple microprocessor-based devices. Instead, everyone will have a core-computing unit, a device that contains a microprocessor, some onboard storage for buffering and offline availability and wireless/cellular radios for cloud connectivity. The device will have a standard interface, developed by a consortium of electronics manufacturers, that allows interoperability, in the same vein as USB standards do today. This device will dock into your car when you drive, have a tablet-sized screen for reading and emailing, engage with a lap-dock when you work from home, or connect to your desk and monitors while at work. This allows for a contiguous user experience while moving from place to place and switching from task to task."
"In 2050, Personal Air Vehicles will be refined and implemented in everyday life. Battery technology will have improved to a very high power density, fulfilling the requirements needed for small electric airplanes, and long duration drones.These Personal Air Vehicles will be autonomous, and a mix of conventional fixed wing airplanes and multirotors. They will not be widely owned, though there may be some ridesharing type services to take advantage of commuting with them. "
"In 2030, we will be able to put on glasses and hang with out friends while in separate rooms. We can talk and walk together while on different sides of the country. Also, there will be a new way to fix things such as house appliances. Have a leaky pipe? Download a tutorial on how to fix it and it will be shown to you step by step on YOUR pipe, in your home."
"School education in 2050Luckily there was a big revolution at school. Children still meet in classes, but rather to be together with 30 other children, now just 5-6 pupils are organized and paired with one adviser for assisting. 50% of the learning takes place in schools, the other 50% take place outside the school to face reality as soon as possible and to experience all subjects.Learning on your device at home is also possible. There is no need to be physically present at school as long as you are connected to your group. But still: most kids prefer to meet in reality.There is no grading at school anymore, the achievements are measured with the solutions you find for all the problems you are confronted with. Real world problems, not educational-fictional problems. 7-year-olds invent universal communicational images, 17-year-olds tackle chemical reaction patterns to find ecological materials.Transport in 2050Building new infrastructures in exciting and crowded cities is always the biggest issue: Modern infrastructure uses tunnels for long distance connections. Some levels are used for human transportation, the very deep levels are used for goods transportation. The first underwater tubes for intercontinental travelling are in preparation.To reduce traffic on streets, private transportation was forbidden years ago: today’s vehicles (still with wheels) are self-driving cars which are all public used. Most people use an electric scooter for short distance travelling. And some people still walk by using their own feet. Surgical operations in 2050. Medicine in 2050Surgeries, of course, will be performed by robot arms for ultra-precise movement, even able to remove and isolate tiny groups of a few cancer cells behind your ear. The robot arms decisions are 100% ki driven (Key Identification) and each action relies on a worldwide health database. Where doctors may perform a few 1000 surgeries for each case in their whole life, this ki-driven health network has seen millions and millions of surgeries and can compare for the perfect treatment.Every baby born in the year 2050 will have a storage for stem cells from the umbilical cord blood. The technology of tissue engineering makes it possible to create any type of body cells from the stem cells to recreate any organ. "
"The actual launch of objects to orbit will be improved by using electromagnetic railguns to put raw materials into orbit, those materials won’t be affected by the huge accelerations and temperature changes of those kind of launches, and the cost will fall ten fold. Once in space, enormous 3D printers will use those materials to build spaceships and entire ecosystems that humans will be able to use. "
"Other megaprojects include the $10 billion, 1,800 km TAPI gas pipeline connecting four countries – Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India – set to be operational by 2020.Now that the Western sanctions on Iran have been lifted, the revival of Rs 1 trillion, 2,775 km Iran-Pakistan Gas pipeline (IP Gas) and LNG smart gas projects could back be on the cards, with potential bilateral trade reaching $5 billion annually in five years."
"The thrust of infrastructure development will pick up game-changing pace when the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects in energy and rail and road construction start to take shape.The four-phase, fast-track work on three road routes – Western, Central and Eastern – connecting Kashgar and Gwadar is in progress to get an early harvest by 2018 and complete the fourth phase by 2030.The CPEC will give us Pakistan’s biggest, 4,800-acre airport at a cost of Rs 22 billion and a world-class port in Gwadar, leased to the Chinese for 43 years.But remember, CPEC is only a means, not an end. It is a corridor, and how we use it is what matters."
"Economically, in a few decades, Pakistan is set to become the world’s eighteenth largest economy by GDP. In terms of GDP purchasing power parity, Pakistan will be the fifteenth largest.Today, Pakistan is the fortieth largest economy with a GDP of $270 billion. According to Goldman Sachs, it will have become a $3.5 trillion economy by 2050.Pakistan will surpass today’s giant economies of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and Taiwan. If governed well, Pakistan could easily leave Italy, Canada and Egypt behind in the 2050 rankings."
"In 2020, machine learning will become a more integral part of our lives, able to perform ever more tasks. Unfortunately, we still cannot trust it to make important decisions. The fact is that machine learning can be fooled. For example, by wearing glasses that are coated in a special way you can cheat a facial recognition algorithm and impersonate someone else. But by 2050 we will have no choice but to trust machine learning everywhere, for example, in self-driving vehicles. In many areas where machine learning outperforms people, it turns out that people are smarter and can easily cheat the system. In general, there are fewer victims, but now a ""hacker"" can kill. In other areas of machine learning applications, the situation is similar."
"Within the next twenty years, it will become common in schools throughout the world to include one or two courses in some form of ""big history"": syllabi that link all disciplines into a coherent, science-based account of how everything came to be as it is.  That will be vital in the world of the Anthropocene to help students link insights from many different disciplines in the sciences and humanities, as they take on the huge challenge of managing an entire planet."
"Some time in the next few years, there will be a political tipping point on the issue of climate change, after which most countries in the world, including the major emitters of greenhouse gases, will commit seriously to cutting emissions, in line with the agreements reached in Paris in 2015.  They will be supported by most sections of the business community and will achieve cuts rapid enough to hold global warming to somewhere between 1.5℃ and 2℃."
"In the year 2030 technology will dominate the workplace with artificial intelligence and smart assistants being common place while the use of augmented and virtual reality continues to increase. Everything will be connected, ""smart,"" and data driven. Jobs will still exist and the vast majority of us will continue working the same way we are today, but the types of jobs will be ones that haven't yet been invented yet. Emotional intelligence and ""human"" skills such as perpetual learning will be crucial for leaders to possess as well as having technological fluency. Work will increasingly become more dynamic as some employees will be virtual, some will be full-time, some employees will be bots, and we will all be working non-fixed hours. As with any kind of change, including technology, there will be both pros and cons. Those who work in routine jobs will likely struggle to make sure they can stay relevant in the new world of work. The advantage is that this will give us more time to focus on the human aspects of work such as building relationships, being creative, deep thinking, and practicing human skills like empathy and self awareness. We need to make organizations more human and interestingly enough, I think technology will help us do that! This of course also means that we need to get more comfortable with using technology such as bots and AI as a regular part of how we work, something which will definitely cause some tension and fear. Ultimately I'm an optimist and I think technology will allow us to solve more problems.And what about non-fixed ours? It depends on if you're talking about knowledge workers vs those who work in industries like retail. Flexible work arrangements are already a huge topic of discussion and are being implemented at organizations around the world currently. The advantages are many ranging from improving employee satisfaction, productivity, and tenure, to being able to attract and retain top talent. The potential disadvantages here are making sure that employees can stay accountable for delivering high quality work, making sure they still feel like they are a part of the team, dealing with loneliness, and ensuring effective communication and collaboration. But here to, I think the pros outweigh the cons and when done effectively, flexible work arrangements can be a huge asset to any organization."
"By 2050, the full genome of hundreds of thousands of organisms such as plants, fungi and animals would have been sequenced by scientists from all around the world. Online databases will give free access to millions of genetic and proteomic sequences, many of them coding for life-saving traits: resistance to diseases, production of medicinal proteins and peptides and nano-engineering discoveries. Using next generation gene editing techniques, those sequences will be inserted into the genomes of other organisms, including Humans. This will allow us to transform life forms as we currently know them. Medical compounds will be commonly produced using specifically designed bacteria and complete, balanced meals will be produced from single varieties of plants, thus allowing for the population growth to continue.The Human genome will be routinely repaired and edited to make the population more resistant to diseases and more performant, both physically and mentally. Gene therapy will most likely be available for multiple conditions but it won't be as trivial as taking a pill. Probably even more complicated than taking a pill! Editing a gene is manageable but to carry that gene inside the target cells without being damaged is a more difficult task. Delivery can already be done using viruses or nano-particles as vessels. It will probably be still relatively expensive and available mainly to the richer part of the world population. The true benefits of gene therapy will become obvious when the effect is permanent, or at least long term (several years). Already now, we can, for certain conditions, alter the DNA of existing cells. However, considering that cells have a variable, limited lifespan, those changes do not last and current gene therapies are of very limited impact. We can hope that by 2050, we will have found a way to alter cell The new era of gene therapyDNA more permanently. The first generation of gene editing tools (CRISPR) shows great potential. I am quite confident that the fourth and fifth generation of gene editing tools will be used more commonly on human beings to bring long term / permanent, beneficial changes to individuals.Will the changes of the genome be inherited by children? That's difficult to say. To be inherited by children, the gametes need to be edited as well and that will involve a whole new level of complexity. Gene therapy will first target specific types of cells in specific organs (e.g. Hepatic stellate cells in the liver, leukocytes) and it's only much later that we might be able to edit the complete genome of an individual. Will it be done by 2050? Probably not (I would imagine that this will take more than 30 years to develop and commercialise)."
"Now, in the year 2050, in Western societies there is widespread acceptance of same-sex love and sexuality. Since the early 2000s, public understanding and support for lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people and their human rights have soared. We know that human culture evolves. Sexual behaviour is part of culture and therefore it too has evolved - and it will even continue to evolve in the future. We already know, through a host of diverse sexual behaviour surveys, that bisexuality is a fact of life, and that a significant and growing proportion of the population are open to both opposite-sex and same-sex attraction. Taboos around same-sex relations have receded, and many more people are having same-sex relationships, even if only temporarily or experimentally.The demise of homophobia makes redundant the need to assert and affirm LGB identity. Historically, LGB identities are largely the product of prejudice and repression. They are a self defence mechanism against homophobia and biphobia. Faced with the persecution we have suffered because of our sexuality we’ve had to assert our right to be LGB. Hence the emergence of a LGB identity and the LGB rights movement.But now in 2050, when one sexuality is not privileged over another in the West, defining oneself according to one’s sexual orientation is no longer necessary. The need to assert LGB rights and identity has declined massively. Since no-one cares who loves who, or who has sex with who, the need for a LGB identity has diminished. Nowadays a person’s sexual orientation doesn't have the social relevance and significance that it used to have.The majority of people, are today (2050) open to the possibility of both opposite-sex and same-sex desires, even if they never act upon them. It is not an issue anymore. People no longer feel the need to label themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or straight, because in this emerging post-heterosexist society no-one cares about a person’s sexual orientation. Desire and love transcend now sexual orientation in the West. We are free and equal humans."
"Now, in 2050, most people are living in small towns rather than big cities. Although the latter have been growing at more or less the same pace as smaller cities in different parts of the world, big cities do not tend to be getting any bigger proportionately. The biggest cities are getting bigger all the time but in general it is medium-sized cities that are going a little faster. From what we know about city sizes, the future will be much the same as the past except, of course, that everything will be bigger as the world population will become ever more urbanised and eventually we will all live in cities.The world’s population is likely to stabilise at around 10 billion by the end of this century (compared to 7 bilion now) and 95% of the 10 billion will be living in cities. What we will see is a lot of cities fusing or merging together. The biggest urban agglomeration in 2050 is the Greater Bay Area(Guangzhou-Zuhai-Macao-Hong-Kong-Shenzhen-Dongguan) with a population of 50 million, and we are going to see a lot more massive agglomerations like this. Small cities are becoming more liveable but in any case are functionally dependent on big cities. ""Small is beautiful"" is a watchword here - Schumacher's argument from the 1970s still holds. The ecological and economic consequences will still be the same for both large and small cities by the year 2050. Ecology is becoming more and more important and some very big issues related to the climate change and pollution will have to be tackled. Property prices are also dependent on the global economy - all one can say about property is that there is always a boom and bust cycle but we may be entering a different regime of world economy, which is more vulnerable."
"It all started in the small countries of north-western Europe. The movement began way back in 2011-12 when one of them went without a government for almost 2 years. But it wasn't until 2020 that the first regional parliament there instituted a second chamber of randomly selected citizens to review legislation. That made other governments around the world take note. Then, after the global crisis of 2023-25 people hit the streets, leaders paid attention, and randomly selected, representative ""citizens' chambers"" began to flourish. Canada replaced its Senate with a citizens’ chamber and, finally – after years of campaigning – the House of Lords in the UK was also replaced with a representative, randomly selected “House of the People”. It wasn't long after that – when people began to realise that these assemblies work well and make good, fair, trusted decisions – that the call to abolish elected chambers all together began to spread like wildfire.Then it happened. After the political crisis in north America in 2039 a couple of US states responded to the crisis by completely replacing their elected legislature with a citizens’ chamber. First it was Oregon, and then the big one: California. Now, in 2050, some countries have followed suit. Among the early adopters were Belgium and The Netherlands in Europe. Who would be next was hard to predict: The depth and breadth of the political movement depended crucially on the local conditions and historical context of each country.Yet the movement continues to grow: Slowly, politicians are becoming a thing of the past. They are now commonly seen as a bizarre historical artefact of that brief period in the 1900s, between the time when parliaments elected by universal suffrage became the norm across half the planet, and the 21st-century spread of the new sortition democracy based on universal, representative random selection.Some of these randomly selected citizens’ representatives love their duties, and a few have become prosperous and famous after their selection, but most find the invasion of privacy troubling and uncomfortable, and several have since gone into hiding to escape the public spotlight. However, the majority are proud of their achievements. They maintain a deep interest in politics, and look back on the two years they served in their local or national parliaments as some of the most important and profound years of their lives. They now understand that every political decision is fundamentally a moral decision. That there is no such thing as the ""best"" or ""right"" political decision – there are only trade-offs to be made when allocating limited resources between competing demands. They are dismissive of those who call for an AI to take over political decision-making. All the millions of AIs operating within every aspect of life in 2050 – no matter how “clever” at diagnosing problems or tracking the implementation of decisions – have nothing to say about what a community of humans values and believes is most important and which members of society are more deserving. Those types of decisions will always require the full diversity of humans communicating and deliberating respectfully with each other, together."
"With virtual reality on the rise, the years 2030-2040 will see VR taken to the next level. Full-dive VR may be some sci-fi stuff but it can be done. What will result from full-dive VR in 2045-2050 is virtual body syndrome or VBS. VBS will be a result of excessive exposure to full-dive games. Example: you have played an RPG game for five years or you have played multiple intense military games, in both of which you have fought for your life. VBS will affect these players, giving them a mental state of perceived invincibility and immortality outside of full-dive. This makes them less worried about taking risks, as they will believe that they can mentally ""respawn"". This effect of VBS could prove to be an advantage to the military. People in our times are afraid of becoming sick and rush to see their doctors in hopes of getting better. These fears, controlled by the human conscious, begin to take their toll on the body in the form of excessive sneezing, rhinorrhea, etc. VBS can give enhanced abilities to people with prolonged video game exposure, depending on the type of games they have played. Their bodies will train to develop new abilities through experience."
"The human civilization of the near future produces a technology that allows objective monitoring and adjustment of every aspect of higher nervous activity: emotion, trains of thought, thought disorders, thoughts, images and sensations, desires, fears, hallucinations, delusions, intellectual capacity, experience, beliefs, and truth or lies in an individual. Some trailblazers succeed in making the technology the common property of the civilization, forestalling attempts by isolated groups.Psychiatry develops into a full-fledged discipline based on objective evidence. We have a clear understanding of when an individual is still sick and when he or she is no longer sick. This provides an impetus to development of new treatment techniques and revision of current ones. The world realizes just how different we all are, how different the speaker’s intended meaning may be from what addressees interpret it to be. It turns out that we, in fact, hardly understand one another despite remaining in constant contact on a daily basis. That realization is truly frightening at first.But then we bounce off that bottom and, rebuilding our social environment with these newly discovered circumstances in mind: no more miscommunication between generations, within families, workforces, communities, nations or countries. Communication becomes fundamentally more efficient. The question of truth and guilt can now be answered definitively in daily life, in public administration, law, personal and all other relationships. Public figures are obliged to disclose their mental state at the time of making decisions. Religious figures, politicians, philosophers and activists can prove their ideas with their mental states.Technology helps us to manage our own thoughts better by providing mental feedback, and our civilization becomes a civilization of demonstrated awareness. Humans realize what they really need, what they really want and what they are good at. Lifetime is now spent much more efficiently. Conflict management, mediation and psychiatry become effective, evidence-based applied disciplines. Technology provides for direct communication of mental states between humans—interpreters are no longer needed. Information is now recorded and distributed as a cohesive sensory-informational flow. Learning becomes relatively immediate and considers individuals' mental state characteristics and talents as the learners grow up.Simultaneously, technology enables research into the mental worlds of many animals: apes, whales, dolphins and many others. Effective interspecific communication is born. A new field of law forms: animals rights and duties, or even the rights and duties of species. They become participants in the building of civilization. Protection of the environment gets a powerful new impetus. New horizons open up for research into the intelligence of lower organisms as well as supraspecific formations like the noosphere or neural networks of the future.Mankind enters new era united, transparent and just. "
"In older times, mute people were outcasts so they couldn't proliferate. Nowadays, they can easily communicate and get all necessary things via Internet. In fact, even people who have voice don't use it much now: messengers, games, business correspondence and multiple web services work quite well without voice. Because of all this, population of mute people is growing fast. After 2050, half of kids in an average kindergarten are mute."
"At first, human memory editing was meant for good: it helped people with terrifying experience to get rid of their bad flashbacks. However, some corporations started to use this technology as a new type of copyright enforcement. Any intellectual property, like a melody or a book, is now ""licensed"" to you for temporary use only. After that, your memory should be swept so you could not even recall that melody ('cos if you recall it you can use it again without a license). For example, after every exclusive live concert, listeners should walk through metal-detector-like frame for memory editing. Some companies use this technology on their employees to keep business secrets from leaks. Of course, there exist ""memory pirates"" who escape memory editing. They still can whistle some Mozart."
"In older days, palms and fingers were scanned for identification. Now, palms and fingers with implanted sensors became scanners themselves. These implants come in different models, yet there are two main variations. First, a simple scanner for daily use: it helps to read different tags and product codes, and to exchange digital business cards via renewed handshake ritual (you still can use face recognition to identify a stranger but this is considered indecent; besides, many people use protection from face recognition - hats with special veils are popular). Another big class of palm/finger scanners are based on more profound implants for technicians and other professionals. For example, ""doctor's hand” includes various medical sensors for diagnostics - even a portable endoscope with direct video stream to doctor’s visual cortex."
"The mass schooling was found to be ineffective. First, it was too abstract and static: kids were forced to seat for hours and passively watch the endless streams of information with no practical use. Second, mass school didn't teach the most important subject - social life; while kids were concentrated on unified tests’ grades, isolated school environment left no room neither time for studying various social roles and relations (except for cheating and bullying).That's why many people abandoned public schools in favor of personalized education - governesses and tutors are popular again. Yet they are not simple babysitters: it's a renewed profession that requires the ability to provide actual knowledge and healthy role models for social behavior though very practical lessons - more like research expeditions or real experience in various jobs rather than abstract classroom study.Unfortunately, only people with good income can afford such a skilled gouverneur - a human one. For others, AI tutors are promoted as an affordable substitute. An AI tutor is a more profound version of a personal AI assistant: it can provide a child with ""educational hints"" via dialogs, games and other activities. Since an AI tutor collects a lot of personal info about a child, it can analyze his abilities and talents to create a personalized training plan. Of course, an AI tutor itself cannot pose as a role model, but it creates a virtual personage, a sort of super-hero to follow, based on kid’s interests and favorite games - this virtual friend accompanies a child everywhere and trains his social interactions."
"It's great when you can control the weather: more rain is sent to drying farmland, and big cities use regular ""sanitary"" rains for cleaning. However, more rain in one country could mean less rain in the other. As soon as hidden methods of weather manipulation are detected, some countries start ""wars for weather"" as they did earlier fighting for other natural resources. Besides, bad weather became a weapon itself: new international treaty is discussed after Asia and America exchanged some artificial hurricanes."
"First AI ghosts appeared on cemeteries soon after personal AI assistants got popular. Since an AI assistant collects lots of personal data of his host (including his vocabulary, voice samples, images and contacts), this machine intellect can successfully imitate his deceased owner in a voice chat or in a 3D hologram. All you need to do is to turn on ""mirror mode"" on a dead person's assistant, and store that AI in a safe place with Internet connection (may be, in a grave with its deceased owner). Later you can come to a cemetery and talk to a holographic “spirit of the dead” - or, if you don't have time to visit those sad places, you can just add your digital grandma to your contact list in Skype. In more distant future, brains of elderly people could be scanned in details before they die so the virtual models of your departed relatives will be even more realistic. Just don't forget to pay the bills for hosting and support."
"Computers have long had the limitation that with every hardware and OS update, ever more older software becomes incompatible. By the 2030s, a new kind of operating system will be developed that will be able to morph its code into whatever form needed to run any program from the past or present. Gone are the days when something would only operate on Mac and not on Windows or vice versa. Want to play antiquated games from the 90s? No problem, the OS will adapt to the software without problems."
"During the last three years the use of smart devices for personal area networks (PAN) has increased dramatically. People are now wearing not only smart watches and fitness trackers, but also smart glasses and bionic chips. Digital personal assistants will force their owners to live healthily and take care of themselves. Government institutions will make use of them to try to influence and control the general public. Cybercriminals too will focus on PAN devices and discover critical vulnerabilities to encrypt personal data and claim ransoms."
"The development of information technology will make digital immortality available to all. This can be achieved through implanting neuro-nanorobots into the brain. Despite having similar properties to ordinary cells, they differ from their living cousins in a number of important ways: they are programmed to interact with a computer; they are immortal; they can draw energy both from the organism and an external source, etc. This type of nanorobot scans information about a cell, writes it to itself, and then replaces the cell. Initially, it is implanted into the blood, whereupon it proceeds to extract vital matter from the biowaste of the body’s organs and build its own copy. The process of replacing the brain takes place over an extended period, and painlessly for the patient, who can continue their daily activity during and after the process. In addition, the patient can load firmware to augment reality or enhance their personality, and after the body’s natural death the brain sends a signal that it needs to be extracted and connected to a special computer. Thus, the person attains digital immortality. This brain will be the center and processor of the data array, and, curiously, will retain its own consciousness."
"Central Australia will be made habitable because of the growing rate of the world’s population. If current birth, death and immigration rates continue in Australia, the population will reach 40 million by 2050. With rural development eventually leading to urbanisation and demographic transitions in Central Australia (bottom of the Northern Territory, parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland). Most of South Australia may become a wind turbine state due to energy consumption projects and massive rail lines linking all the state capitals and other parts of Australia together."
"Toasters can cause serious burns. Electric fans can fall into the bath, with shocking results. Refrigerators with auto food ordering can purchase products or suggest exotic dishes that will surely finish you off. Luxury electric cars on autopilot can calmly smash into a lamppost. Smart homes could turn terrorist, taking entire families hostage. Or a spray-applied new-fashioned dress will suddenly become transparent during an official presentation. People typically associate the words ""cyberthreats"" and ""cyberterrorism"" with planes, trains, nuclear power plants, and other large industrial facilities. Or perhaps the US elections. But we’re forgetting about the ubiquitous interconnectedness of the machines and appliances that make up the Internet of Things. Standard household appliances connected to the Internet are often the source of problems and threats. A robot pet could make off with a wallet, or a robot vacuum cleaner could destroy a flash drive or a paper document with information worth billions. And a crazy coffee maker could scold a human operator flying an aircraft or driving a train. To prevent all this from happening, programmers will need to develop anti-virus and anti-hacker software, while futurologists and fixers will need to algorithmize all possible ""misuse"" scenarios for common appliances and devices."
"Households will see the appearance of robot garbage collectors that ""manually"" sort rubbish, flattening, weighing, dehumidifying, and packaging it in the process. Garbage is given a marketable look. When sufficient quantity for a sale is reached, the robot automatically makes a deal with a private company offering a good price for the garbage. The robot’s owner can intervene in the deal-making process. The robot garbage collector’s duties include searching for precious metals in waste, their valuation, and online commission-based selling of goods that the owner has suddenly decided to get rid of. The garbage collectors come to the house after a deal is struck and remove the domestic waste, which for them is a marketable product. The garbage collectors will themselves explain what waste they'll give a good price for, what they'll take for free, and what needs payment from the customer to have recycled. Most garbage operations (sorting, transportation, accumulation) are performed by robots at both ends of the chain. The robot garbage collector unerringly separates the garbage, and not into three or four groups at that, but hundreds of different categories. It also controls the consistency of the waste, ensuring the right proportions as required by the processing technology, thus turning the garbage into high-quality raw material for industrial processing. Ever newer industrial technologies are being created specially for this process, replacing the use of primary raw materials with secondary. Non-recyclable waste is gradually disappearing as recycling competitiveness raises production competitiveness to a higher level than for production employing traditional technologies with the use of primary raw materials. Civilization is entering a higher phase in which the raw materials it uses are not turned into garbage as such, but simply converted from one form of existence to another ad infinitum."
"The year is 2026. The ""state services"" portal is evolving. Amendments will be made to Federal Law No. 59-FZ ""On the Procedure for Considering Appeals of Citizens of the Russian Federation,"" Federal Laws No. 19-FZ and No. 20-FZ, and other laws on elections in Russia. The state will create an online feedback-type system for real-time monitoring, polls, focus groups, and expert interviews of both consumers of public services and government officials, as well as for receiving complaints. The system can be used to take part in elections, referendums, and opinion polls to voice views on the current political agenda. Besides providing statistical information and solving managerial tasks, the system will facilitate the drafting of strategic documents on state development, backed by genuinely expressed public opinion and the positions of industry experts. Every message/application/complaint will be classified in a certain way. This kind of technology is already applied in analyzing the ""Direct Line"" live Q&A sessions between the Russian president and public. The results of quantitative analysis of such applications should reveal system errors and miscalculations by individual divisions in specific regions. Qualitative analysis should offer standard solutions to problems faced by applicants or the option to deal directly with an official. Laws will be implemented like algorithmic procedures. Indeed, the lawmaking process itself will closely resemble the development of computer programs and applications. Bureaucrats will need fast-track programming classes. Incidentally, the high-sounding “Master of Requests” was a legal expert who handled complaints filed by citizens against officials (the post was introduced in Russia by Peter the Great)."
"An in-depth model of global events will be created (a detailed model of the globe with ultra-high temporal and spatial resolution—a breeze for the supercomputers of the future). The model will consist of a virtual globe, with all past events reconstructed in 3D format, modeled virtually. The globe will work according to the same basic principle as Wikipedia, allowing anyone to add new events. Newly added events will be processed by a program that reconstructs what was, or could have been, just as the vivid human fantasy imagines it. This can be achieved through developing AI algorithms able to independently create images on the basis of a detailed description, historical chronicle, story, or video documentary. AI will also be used for statistical analysis of social media content in sociological research."
"The city is a cosmodrome in the form of a giant tower scraping the lower layers of the mesosphere, with a tent-shaped base in which three tiers emulate different climatic zones. Besides residential areas, the city is home to a business center, R&D institute, university, and factory. Externally, the tower resembles a rod which nearer the base spreads out in different directions via a multitude of tunnels that terminate with arches. The tower summit expands in the shape of a disk on which the cosmodrome is sited; inside is a hotel for space tourists and admirers of the stunning views of Earth. Cargo for delivery to space is transported along a magnetic road to a sorting center, from where an electromagnetic elevator takes it to the launch pad. The required number of returnable traction modules are attached to deliver the cargo into orbit. The modules with empty containers fall back to the Vostochny Cosmodrome, specially adapted to receive them."
"Medicine and technology (like all human progress) do not stand still. We are seeing ever more successful studies and examples of practical implementation in such areas as: prosthetics; implantation; functional exo-tools for simplifying various tasks; cultivation of artificial cells and tissues for restoring injured areas of the body. It is hard to imagine that there won't be plenty of supply from cutting-edge science and demand from those wanting to augment themselves. Improvements to the human body will become mainstream.For example, biomechanical hands will give the average person Herculean strength. This advanced area will likely encompass the development of other improvements such as the use of prosthetic limbs and implants to overcome physical disabilities resulting from wars or industrial accidents, enhancing the human body in the process.  Besides restoring lost functionality, such artificial limbs can give the wearer added capabilities.Result: a possible scenario is the simultaneous development of exo-technologies and restoration (artificial cultivation and/or prosthetics), raising humanity to a new level of evolution. In addition to restorative prosthetics and external ""upgrades,"" various individual characteristics will be enhanced through augmentation and implantation.In 2050, augmentation will be at a high level in terms of performance and reliability; the consumer base will be wide, and the ethical and legal norms governing the work of manufacturers and researchers will be far-reaching. As will the rights, limitations, and permissions of end users."
"The deployment of 5G systems (2020-2021) will mark the start of the global transition of all remaining media to the Internet. The FM band will move online, where radio stations will show live video broadcasts from their colorful studios. It will be a new kind of TV, and the old version will have to raise its game. The former FMers will snatch a juicy piece of the advertising pie from TV. By 2030, FM radio will have been shut down in more than 70% of the world’s countries. All content (video and audio) will be available online. The Internet is practically free."
"The usual method of mining will be out of favor. Thanks to the development of spacecraft and the application of new technologies, mineral-rich meteorites will be delivered from the asteroid and Kuiper belts. Alongside extracting minerals from lumps of rock and capturing stones directly at the station, this mode of transportation will become more popular, since extraction inside meteorites will be infeasible due to their small dimensions, while the capture of materials by space mining stations will be hindered, conversely, by their large dimensions. After mandatory scanning for degree of saturation and resource cost, transportation will be organized to the nearest as-yet uninhabited objects of the solar system, where only quake-resistant plants will be located. Meteorites will be dropped, for example, on Mars or the Moon. Due to the lack of atmosphere, they will not burn up, but land in specially prepared zones. The surface impact will break up the rock, simplifying the extraction of metals and minerals from small blocks. Small comets saturated with ice will also be captured."
"In the future, the development of artificial intelligence will lead to people ceding power to smart machines due to their greater reliability and inability to lie or take bribes. AI decisions will be thought out many moves ahead, with all risks factored in and adjustments made as circumstances change. Governments formed on the basis of AI and various bodies—such as the executive branch, departments interacting with the public and overseeing AI actions, and sections responsible for checking AI-drafted protocols—will have a more positive influence over people’s security, well-being, and stability."
"Ecology is one of the most important areas of human life. In 2050, the UN division responsible for preserving the Earth in its original form will begin to sound the alarm on deforestation. Unless it’s stopped, they say, the Earth faces irreversible changes. Since the second industrial revolution put a tablet or other portable electronic device into the hands of every person, it will be decided to ban paper as an information medium, together with all wood-cellulose products. This will happen gradually, over two decades, starting from 2030. First, the production of matches, furniture, and other goods will cease (the market will switch to light, strong types of plastic), and paper factories will eventually close down. For future generations, paper books will likely become the property of wealthy collectors and aesthetes, but the printed page will always be accessible in public buildings known as libraries, which will regain popularity. The rarity of real books will be compensated by the cleaner air breathed by our children and grandchildren."
"Genetic engineering will enable the human genotype to be altered in certain parts of the adult body. With genetic engineering, hair coloring, manicures, and pedicures will become simple and affordable. The effects will not fade after a month. They will last forever—or until your next visit to the salon for another new look. Tattoos will appear and disappear at the owner’s command, controlled via a neural interface. Glowing tattoos using phosphoric cells will be in vogue, on a par with beautiful clothes. They will become a fashion statement. A new kind of bling that is quite literally skin deep. People will change their image more often, and far more easily."
"By 2050 there will be a new leisure activity called ""Life: from start to finish."" It will go something like this: the participant will be immersed in a state of sleep in which the brain is under the influence of special drugs and neurocomputers, creating a kind of reality inside the person. The sleeping person will not be aware that they are living a different life, and within 2-3 days of normal time they will live an entire life internally. From the cradle to the grave. Special computers will generate the surrounding environment, creating a full life in every respect, Matrix-style. Dying in the internal world will cause the participant to wake up in the real one. Potentially harmful memories of non-existent places or people will be forgotten, but useful skills and knowledge will remain. If the sleeping person “grew up” in a foreign country, for instance, the language, history, and mentality of this virtual homeland will stay with them. Scientific knowhow could be streamed into the mind. It will take the concept of “edutainment” to a new level. Young people having lived a virtual life will be smarter and more mature as a result. They will be less rash and understand the consequences of their actions. What’s more, there will various levels of difficulty for people from all walks of life. They will be able to select lives that vary greatly in terms of complexity and challenges. Perhaps we’re already playing it right now?"
"In 2050, people will come to realize that the pursuit of a high octane rating has destroyed the planet's ecology. Earth must either be restored or abandoned.  Since the second option will not yet be feasible, all scientific and material resources will go towards restoring our damaged world. The first step will be an attempt to create a Dyson Sphere to extract more energy from the Sun. Although likely to fail, such frenetic activity in space caused by building just one segment of the Sphere will not go unnoticed by other, more advanced civilizations, which will surely seek to make contact with humankind on observing a level of development comparable to their own.  And they will either help restore the planet to its former conditions or go back to where they came from. In the first case, the restoration will complete and cooperation with other civilizations will continue, while in the second, an attempt will be made to create a nuclear fusion reactor, which will probably be successful. After the development of a near eternal (by human standards) energy source, a huge technological leap will occur, propelling us finally into outer space. It’s quite possible (and even likely) that the Dyson Sphere project will never get past the drawing board, in which case a powerful thermonuclear reactor will appear even sooner."
"In Tyumen, next to the Eternal Flame memorial, or the nearby Stone monument, or at the entrance to the City Duma museum (or in all three places), street time capsules will be installed with secure safes allowing people to drop letters addressed to future generations—either open messages to everyone or personal ones to their direct descendants. Letter or postcards (larger items can be checked by museum staff) are dropped into the so-called “time mailboxes” (another name for the street time capsules), each one indicating the year of delivery to the recipient. This is how it will look. Ten mailboxes are lined up next to each other, and each displays the year of delivery: 2030, 2045, 2050, 2060, 2070, 2080, 2090, 2100, 2110, 2120. After being dropped into the mailboxes, all letters are placed inside waterproof and fireproof safes in semi-automatic mode—not immediately, but after some time to make sure that the paper is not contaminated with a fungal infection (an expert, not necessarily a living person, maybe an AI robot, will check the material for long-term storage potential). The safes can be opened on the day of the city or at New Year, depending on the delivery date indicated on the safe. The exact opening date will be specified on the individual mailbox... The mailboxes will also specify the requirements for the message material. For durable media, such as birch bark, mailboxes with delivery dates stretching into the fourth millennium can be provided. Messages on birch bark should be imprinted so that they are still legible after thousands of years."
"Numerous studies in the field of cybernetics and bioengineering are beginning to bear fruit. Earlier models of chips implanted in the human body were used only for transmitting data about the owner to GlobalNet or a private hospital network, making purchases, computer access, or simply as a security pass for various places. They had many flaws, notably weak security, incomplete compatibility with networks, and (in rare cases) individual intolerance to components in the implanted chip. Identify theft and falsification of bank account data, passport data data, and health information were not uncommon. Recent research has allowed the chip to become a more active element in the human body and receive synaptic and biochemical data on the person’s health and mood. This has made it possible to link the security system to biochemical indicators; to introduce basic alterations, it is now necessary not only to have an individual access key, but to synchronize it with an overall indicator of the person's health, which must be done at a specialized center. The automatic security systems of public buildings are able to deny access if a person is aggressively minded or advise patients to seek medical assistance if their vital signs worsen. Cars will be blocked if drivers are in a depressed, aggressive, or intoxicated condition, or switch to autodrive if the indicators deteriorate on the road. For the seriously ill, special chips will be able to transmit health data to a hospital’s neural network via an additional element (embedded in a watch, bracelet, ring, communication device, or other preferred accessory) that also functions as a firewall. Modern 3D printing technologies in the field of medicine have solved the problem of biological compatibility—now chips are combined with cellular adsorbents based on the body’s own cells."
"A special type of glass will be produced for sunglasses, cars, and other items and vehicles. A light analyzer will locate the source of bright light and the eye pupil. A simple algorithm will cause a small speck or darkened area to move across the glass, blocking the light source. Externally, it can be any kind of glass. It will be useful for working in orbit, driving (dimming oncoming vehicle headlights), sunbathing, protecting against projectors and floodlights, welding, etc."
"EU countries have adopted a joint resolution on the total control over the upbringing of children. High taxes have made it impossible to maintain a family on one salary, meaning that both parents have to work and children are obliged to stay in school or another public institution for the duration of the day. Thus, European parliamentarians legitimized the long-standing Swedish practice of breaking social, in particular family, ties."
"The year is 2055. Quantum computers have achieved such power that they are capable of fully emulating the human brain. It is now possible to ""load"" the human mind onto a computer, solving the ""duplicate paradox"": the person's actual identity is loaded onto the server, not a copy of it. Only for ordinary citizens, it’s a very expensive procedure. It takes many years of work to pay off the mortgage for a dedicated soul-storage server. And God forbid that you die prematurely, or your insurance company revokes your license. That said, your family can continue to pay the mortgage for you. And in the ""afterlife"" you will retain property rights; you will be able to compose music, write books, code software, operate machinery at work, etc. In the virtual world, you will have access to beautiful bodies, luxury entertainment, palaces, yachts—all for a fee, of course, since the work of programmers should be compensated. You can visit your living relatives as a hologram. Finally, for a very large sum of money, you can rent the body of a living person or use a clone dummy. Antivirus services and maintenance of software shells for ""virtual citizens"" will become part of daily life; installing new software will be like a visit to the doctor. The main question about the future is whether ""virtual citizens"" will retain voting rights. As times passes, the more numerous they’ll become. We’ll even see the appearance of political parties representing their interests. Most likely, society will cease to develop for hundreds of years: why change anything if the main goal of immortality has been achieved? A totalitarian anti-utopia under the unlimited power of corporations—the givers of eternal life! This prediction is based on the author's sci-fi story and screenplay ""Mortgage for Grandpa"" (lodged, under notary)"
"The 21st century has seen the coming to power of the Internet giants; almost all services people use belong to a handful of majors.The result of the tech revolution is the transition to a newer network infrastructure based on satellites covering the entire surface of the Earth. People will go about their daily lives without even suspecting that skipping just one small system check will put their precious personal data at risk.So the 2050s will witness the biggest leak in human history. The satellite network will be compromised, and user data intercepted by the hacker group responsible will be uploaded to the public domain (logins/passwords/photos/private messages). 90% of all people and organizations on the planet will be affected. The ensuing chaos will be hard to bring under control. Corporations and countries will try to mitigate the consequences as best they can, although it’s unlikely that even Elliot Alderson will be able to cope. The ""incident"" (as it was originally called in the media) will be on a par with the most frightful terrorist acts of the 20th and 21st centuries, but everything will be self-defeating: the stolen data that people want access to will spread like wildfire, and only part of it will be deleted.In the mid-2050s, Elon Musk will deliver a report to the UN on the infeasibility of controlling the flow of information. The upshot will be the legalization of companies specializing in selling personal data; hacking will become officially legal. So for a half a bitcoin it will be possible to gain access to the leaked data and directly impact people's lives. The terms ""private life"" and ""private data"" will become obsolete.A new ruling structure will appear in some parts of the world, known as plirofocracy (from the Greek word for “information”). Knowledge will be power like never before. Resource-rich groups will peddle any information on their servers, entirely legally.But against the backdrop of all the horror unfolding in the 2050s and 60s, a small section of society will emerge dissatisfied with the regime— the last stronghold of information security. These cyberheroes will live with just one goal in mind: to save the still-savable."
"On the back of developing machine-learning tools and creating the new interdisciplinary scientific discipline ""retrospective futurology,"" AI will initially study the history of all forecasts and predictions, derive general patterns, and then learn how to predict the future better than humans. ""Retrospective futurology"" will be taught in universities as a core subject of both social and technical sciences. What could be more exciting than studying past people’s view of the future! Unfortunately, many professional futurists and prognosticators will remain unemployed and without grants. Except for cases when it’s necessary to predict totally unreal phenomena beyond the scope of machine logic."
"Whether or not a space elevator can ever be built remains to be seen. However, it is possible to create a system to minimize the cost of delivering cargo. Theoretically, such a system is already doable for unmanned small satellites. It requires a vacuum tube with electromagnetic accelerator guideways. This tube rests on a high mountain peak and stretches upwards to an altitude of around 10 km. Even higher, up to 30 km, is possible if stratospheric balloons are used. Projectiles inside the tube can be accelerated to first cosmic velocity. If the tube is 300-400 km long to ensure smooth acceleration and minimal overload, manned vehicles can be launched. What's more, there's no need to accelerate to 8-9 km/s. Half that speed is sufficient. It's enough for the shuttle to be supplied with a reaction mass for the engines, while energy can be transmitted to it via a laser beam from a solar power station flying at altitude."
"Movies and TV shows will be based on continuous monitoring of target audiences’ interests and preferences. Not only will viewers get to vote on the project, theme, and genre, but also advise screenwriters and directors about plot devices and finales. As a result, Russian cinema and TV will improve. Yet film and TV products will be unprofitable if there is no tie-in with the video game, literature, and comic book industries, as well as consumer goods. The creators of ""umbrella brands""—authors, screenwriters, and filmmakers will set trends in the world of fashion and consumption. Everyone will want a superhero car or a handbag like a movie heroine. The author expresses the hope that hard sci-fi will once more become the dominant genre in cinema and literature."
"Due to the ongoing emergence of new drugs and new methods of cheating, doping control in major sports will be abolished. All medications to improve athletic performance will be allowed. Before competition, athletes will only be checked to ensure no electric muscle stimulators or boosting implants. As a result, professional athletes will differ from ordinary people as much as a racing car from a family minivan. However, the use of doping will not improve results all that much, since it will only legitimize what athletes have long been taking already, albeit illegally."
"The invention of high-strength synthetic materials will give rise, quite literally, to flying machines powered by human brawn.  There will also appear various hybrid aircraft powered by muscular and solar energy. People will fly not only by catching air currents as before with gliders, but also against the wind and for much greater distances."
"By 2050, mental devices to input information will be in use everywhere. People will transfer instructions to their computers and devices mentally, without using a keyboard, mouse, joystick, etc. This will facilitate and speed up the work of artists, designers, architects, composers, and other creatives. And it will do wonders for DJs and their armies of clubbers :)"
"Come 2050, globalization and migration have reached unprecedented levels: everyone on the planet wants the best living environment. And for many that means getting to Mariarnia, a megalopolis located in the once lifeless territory of the Sahara. This is the first UN member country not to guarantee birthright citizenship. People here become citizens on a competitive basis: applicants for vacant positions must have something to contribute to this futuristic utopia. Mariarnia is the ideal place for development, creativity (what used to be called ""work""), and life. Crime and prison are unknown here. If someone succumbs to weakness and commits a misdemeanor, he or she must make amends within two weeks, otherwise they are deprived of citizenship and expelled from the agglomeration. This country-corporation leads the way in every field of scientific progress: medicine, genetics, fundamental science, information technologies. All these intellectual developments are exported to the outside world."
"IT developments will enable students to sit university entrance exams remotely. Tasks and case studies are randomly selected from a common pool of science and engineering problems in the real economy, or creative projects. Answers will checked by university professors and industry pros likewise randomly selected from a common pool. People are evaluated by people, but without subjective bias or corrupt practices. And the innovative economy receives a stream of employees with meta-subject, socio-cultural, cognitive, and other types of skills. Since an increasing role in the economy is played by robots and automated systems, there is no need for a production line of standardized specialists selected on the basis of one-size-fits-all school exams. We need people able to plan, develop, and optimize business and production processes; design and renovate social mega-systems. We need creative advancement and the production of specialists needed for the economy."
"By 2030, hulking terrestrial wind turbines have been partially replaced by energy-generating drones.The drones are tethered to a ground station by means of a cable through which wind energy is transferred. The generator itself is installed either on the drone in which case, power is generated by its rotating blades. Also it can be placed at the ground station where the power is generated by the action of the wind-tossed drone tugging on the cable.Drones are able to climb to an altitude ranging from 200 meters to a kilometer — where the winds are constant. Their wind turbine predecessors operated at a height where the air movement was unpredictable, resulting in lots of downtime. The compact, eco-friendly, and readily installable stations quickly spread around the world."
"The Arabian Desert, once one of the most lifeless places on Earth, no longer matches that description: Come 2050, it is home to the world’s first ""electric"" town. That means all of its infrastructure is powered solely by electrical energy. Driverless electric cars roam the streets of the small town, and all buildings are equipped with automatic climate and lighting control systems, both inside and out. The project was made possible by new technology for harvesting solar energy directly from outer space.It works as follows: A huge power station equipped with solar batteries is fired into near-Earth orbit. At that altitude, atmosphere and day cycles are no longer in play, which means constant sunlight. The harvested solar energy is transferred from the station to the Earth's surface by a microwave beam transmitted by giant antennas. The microwave beam is aimed at a receiving antenna approximately 5 km (about 3 miles) in diameter, roughly the area of 2,750 soccer fields.The hefty price tag of putting the station in orbit and post-launch maintenance required every country on the Arabian Peninsula to chip in. In doing so, they demonstrated that such towns can exist without oil and other nonrenewables. Locals are employed mainly in servicing the power station, adjusting its orbit and the direction of the Earth-bound beam."
"Climate change will melt much of the ice in Antarctica. With this, the ice becomes softer and easier to drill ice cores. Russian scientists from Vostok Station, along with others from the international community, will drill larger ice cores and perhaps even shafts down which field scientists will be hoisted. These scientists may discover thousands of new species, including creatures as complex as arthropods."
"Siberian fur traders started an experiment in 1959 to calm the temperament of the red fox so they could harvest their furs. By 2040, the domesticated fox will have become its own subspecies."
"Climate change will cause worse and worse weather, including hurricanes that will severely disrupt the way of life in India's Andaman Islands. Outsiders no longer being the greatest threat to the North Sentinalese, the uncontacted tribe will ruefully accept aid from non-islanders, leading to greater knowledge to non Sentinalese of their culture."
"By the year 2050, the first floating ""seasteads"" will have been initiated, the first of which will be government funded projects. Over time, whole offshore cities will appear, many even becoming sovereign or privatized. These will be fully sustainable, using the power of the ocean, sun, and wind to generate electricity. Water will come from filtered ocean water, and seafood will be a staple of the diet."
"By 2050 drastic measures have been taken to preserve coastal cities below or close to sea level. Currently, climate scientists predict that a 2℃ rise in global average temperature will result in a 50cm rise of sea level. By 2050, that number will be greater. Venice is, at average, just 1m above sea level; at its lowest point, the city is only 80cm above mareographic zero - this is the Piazza San Marco. For years Venice has been threatened by flooding, but now a project has commenced to nullify this risk. Giant barriers have been constructed on all of the city’s oceanfront areas, protecting the city from an inundation of seawater. Despite this success, there are other problems that come with climate change, including augmented wave heights and increased amounts of freak weather events. And to these problems, another solution has been created. Further out to sea, a number of oceanic surge-control facilities loom above the sea surface. They have been placed strategically around the city for maximum efficiency. Hubs of current-controlling technology, these facilities regulate the size and power of potential waves to ensure that hazardous swells do not reach Venice. This system prevents the coastal city from being swept beneath the waters of the Adriatic sea, preserving Venice for future generations."
"With the use of modern technologies (intelligent machines, IoT, grid sensors, drones and autonomous robots) of monitoring, prediction and management the agribusiness will evolve towards decentralized control and more sustainable production. Where every producer or rancher will know exactly how much their business is doing well, or what they are doing wrong. We will have an integrated digital food business system focused on small businesses with high-quality products for the end customer and for society, together with the application of sustainability and nature preservation policies."
"By 2030, the language barrier was behind us, and knowledge of foreign languages was no longer a job requirement. The universal translator successfully handles speech recognition and simultaneous interpreting with a delay of less than one second and close to 100% accuracy. Many simultaneous interpreters are out of a job, although important talks are still entrusted to experienced human pros. The universal translator is basically a small earpiece equipped with a speaker and microphone, connected to your smartphone via a wireless link. The device is called “Babel Fish” in honor of a creature from Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In the book, the Babel fish is a small, yellow, leech-like fish inserted in the ear, where it interprets speech telepathically.The “fish” is most commonly used by tourists — the days of getting lost in a strange city are no more, since it’s always possible to ask for directions (although geopositioning also makes it hard to lose your way). By 2040, the universal translator covered around 50 of the most widely spoken languages in the world.Oddly enough, students and schoolchildren continue to learn foreign languages: either in preparation for a post-nuclear apocalypse, or simply to read poetry in the original. People fluent in foreign languagesare considered intellectuals, although behind their backs some call them old-fashioned."
"Personal assistants have seen rapid development throughout the first half of the 21st century. To begin with, they could only answer primitive questions: in 2020 voice assistants were as dumb as a sack of hammers. But by 2025 PAs had mastered the art of recognizing and transcribing speech (with punctuation marks, too); they could understand the meaning of a text and recite it so realistically that it was almost indistinguishable from a living human being. This meant that half of all office activities were finally automated: PAs began to take minutes, write post-meeting reports, summarize lengthy documents, and consciously digest and recapitulate the contents of messages. They also plan your day, schedule meetings, and order lunch.Thanks to machine learning, PAs are fully adapted to their owners’ personalities, increasingly penetrating every aspect of their lives. It all began with assisting with office work, and by the mid-2040s PAs had become an integral part of everyday life, monitoring their owners’ diets, planning trips abroad, buying gifts for friends and family, and much more. But it's not all as rosy as it seems: the human-PA relationship has spawned a plethora of psychological diseases and communication difficulties between real people. However, a specially trained AI psychologist is at hand to help cope with such psychological issues — ironically, it’s basically just another voice assistant."
"In 2050, remote working and telecommuting are finally legalized in most professions, even emergency paramedics (yes, this job still cannot be assigned to AI). When the call comes, the doctor puts on a set of VR glasses and gloves, and inhabits a robot avatar. The doctor sees with robot eyes and controls manipulators, even feeling their resistance, making it possible to remotely massage a patient’s heart. Robot avatars are dotted throughout the city where fire hydrants and medical kits are located today. Such avatars are used in any emergency. In autonomous mode, they are great at extinguishing fires. They don’t work as cleaners, since there are still cheaper options for that.Only authorized people can take control of avatars to prevent maniacs from unleashing hell. Yet contract killings with the help of avatars do occur from time to time. Most of them go unsolved."
"By 2030 around 40% of all buildings in Dubai will be built using 3D-printing technology. The first architectural project made with a 3D printer was created in the United Arab Emirates back in 2016. By 2025 the value of the market for 3D-printing in construction reached 1 billion dollars, and new developments in technology made it possible for it to be applyed to the construction of the high-rise buildings that Dubai is famous for. This approach allows for a significant reduction of costs and a considerable simplification of production for certain parts of a building, at the same time preserving its reliability and functionality."
"The specifics of its location and lack of fresh water makes the city unfit for agriculture. That's why food imports are such a considerable expense for the city.To compensate for the lack of natural resources in the region, Italian architects from Studiomobile have developed the Seawater Vertical Farm project that utilises what few resources there are in the region to grow ecologically clean products.70% of all freshwater in the world is used in agriculture but in many regions, there's an acute shortage. In areas with an abundance of the seawater, however, desalination provides a lifeline to agriculture. A lack of fertile soil and freshwater in Dubai make it the ideal place for seawater farms which enable an increase in domestic food production in the Emirates.Based on the system of seawater greenhouses in Oman and Gran Canaria, Studiomobile's Vertical Seawater Farm uses salt water for cooling and moisturizing air in greenhouses while the sunlight transforms it into fresh water, giving life to thousands of plants. Compared to the majority of modern desalinating equipment, that use expensive and energy-consuming methods of boiling and pressurisation, a vertical seawater farm works passively, going through three desalination phases and making it possible to harvest plants all year long."
"Originally of little significance, Al Maktoum international airport becomes one of the largest in the world by 2040.The reason for this is that Dubai's international airport, located four kilometers from the capital can no longer cope with ever-increasing passenger traffic. In 2030 the airport had more than 190 million passengers, by 2040 this will go up to 260 million and by 2050 this number is predicted to reach 309 million. Considering that it was nearly impossible to further expand the existing main international airport that had already been serving 100 million passengers a year in 2020, building new space for Al Maktoum was the only viable solution. As a result, Al Maktoum international airport, 40 km away from Dubai, became the new base hub with 5 air strips and the ability to serve more than 200 million passengers a year."
"By 2040, Dubai becomes a leader in autonomous vehicles - a significant number of all trips are undertaken in driverless transport - not only cars but also buses, trams, underground trains as well as many forms of water and air transport.Success here was achieved due to active support from the city’s administration. Ensuring maximum efficiency and security required huge investment in “smart” infrastructure, cyber-attack prevention and systems to manage adverse weather conditions. A lot of time and energy was spent developing regulations and helping people get over their fear and prejudices.All transport is controlled by one Management Center."
"The expanding city, along with its polluted environment and a lack of natural resources such as fresh water, made industrial space optimisation a key issue for the city.To avoid building large industrial zones within the city limits, Dubai creates vertical factories, allowing for maximum convenience and efficient logistics. This makes it possible to have a large production capacity in minimum space, minimising damage to the environment and increasing the efficiency of each object. Vertical factories need less resources, utilising them in many processes at the same time where possible, rendering them much more energy efficient."
"The notion of a person with a disability is slowly disappearing. Even the worst injury is no longer an obstacle to living a full life. People who cannot walk, can travel freely around the city, or even the globe, in a virtual space. Or, if they prefer, they can do it in real life too — using robotic wheelchairs.A personal carrier can move around the city autonomously. And if the user starts feeling bad the device can immediately administer first-aid and transport the person to the nearest medical centre."
"Drones have started to play an even more important role in people’s lives. Now they carry out even the most mundane tasks. For example, an umbrella drone can be rented in any part of the city. You just place an order — and the robot will fly over to you in a few minutes. A smart umbrella floats above the person until the rain stops and then flies back to the charging station."
"A new system of loop-like floating towers located on the surface of nearby harbours has become an agricultural hub that functions all year round. This concept is based partly on previous experiments with floating fish farms, used in the region since the 1930s. Those farms were primitive wooden structures situated close to the shore and functioning both as small markets and as ’ponds’ for fish and lobsters.The looped form lets this vertical construction absorb more light, almost entirely eliminating shadows, thus contributing to faster plant growth.A sensor network, located on the surface of towers, monitors the conditions and growth of the plants and sends this information to the city control centre."
"From an initial idea to build floating houses, we now see an impressive ship-complex. A 100-metre floating platform with a cruiseliner-like space inside. It is practically static, anchored in one place and maintains near-perfect balance, even during the strongest storms. This is possible due to the collective work of many different engines that compensate for water currents and wind direction. However, if needed, this floating house can also leisurely move to a new location."
"Robotics and artificial intelligence have become so advanced that human intervention into their daily activity is rarely required. Nonetheless, there are still some tasks that need a human operator and, in this case, the system transfers control to a human. The person’s movements are then scanned by a multitude of sensors and a robot presenter copies them exactly, whilst simultaneously transmitting the speech of the person as well. The human operator sees and hears everything that is available to the robot at that moment.Similar technology is now also used for research in situations deemed too hazardous for humans and in medicine to help prevent severely ill patients losing touch with society during their treatment."
"The advancement of nanotechnology has made ‘smart surfaces’ possible. Any wall or window can be equipped with thousands of invisible cameras, microphones, speakers and sensors detecting temperature, light, proximity or geolocation. Furthermore, they can display holographic images. The ‘smart surface’ can send and receive data remotely by connecting to home or city computer systems, reacting to the constantly changing environment and adapting to these changes, always interacting with users and predicting their behaviour.This technology is used in the information-driven navigation system of a city that helps citizens and tourists receive interesting information via holographic projections that can show the shortest path to their destination or a historical landmark and describe it in detail."
"Plastic waste in the sea led to the formation of a massive garbage patch in the centre of the Pacific Ocean in late 20th century. Its area has continued to grow and exceed 1 million sq.km. by 2030. Plastic waste can be recycled and this has become the most popular way to fight pollution. To prevent waste getting into the sea, ecological drones with solar batteries have been deployed and now they are constantly working on cleaning coastal territories from plastic and delivering it to recycling plants."
"Singapore’s administration no longer uses static billboards, preferring modern technology. Solar-battery drones can use their built-in holographic projectors to display the most complex images and video. The content of an ad depends on its location and often changes depending on the gender and age of the targeted person (drones are equipped with image recognition systems). Ignoring this kind of personalised advertising is much more difficult but it is possible to pay a small amount of money to unsubscribe.These drones don’t only serve commercial purposes — they also help maintain order, notifying the police of any problems or violations."
"New Singaporean architecture reflects the impact that ecological concerns and rational resource consumption have had on it. New eco-buildings combine a residential area and a vertical farm. This kind of approach makes it possible to use a small space to create an energy-efficient agricultural centre that maximises the use of solar energy, reuses waste products and ensures the recirculation of fresh water."
"Toronto, Ontario, Canada's largest city has close to a dozen super tall condo buildings in its downtown area. By this time Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) will be home to 8.5 million people, Toronto alone 3.5 million people. Self-driving vehicles will be the norm in mid-2030's onwards. Yonge Street Living (YSL) supertall condo building will be the city's main super tall condo with offices, retail spaces on the bottom floors and resident suites on the top floors."
"Historically, exponential growth has never lasted for a long time, except perhaps in two areas: global GDP and unemployment. These are still growing with no end as yet in sight.Yet population growth, which many had assumed to be on an exponential trajectory, has long been slowing. It’s already unlikely to top 10 billion. The reason is not a lack of resources — quite the opposite, in fact. A correlation between child mortality and number of children per family was discovered: in short, no one wants to have quite so many kids as before.Returning to GDP, it too will ultimately hit the asymptote. And unemployment could be the cause — at some point it will approach 100% of the (non-robotic) population, largely because people wouldn’t have anything to strive for. High labor productivity will mean that most needs are met (unemployed people in rich countries are already doing fine), and it will become prohibitively difficult for humans to do anything new and useful. Machines will become ultra-smart, and only a tiny percentage of people will be needed to control them. The upshot is that GDP will stop growing, and AI smartness will plateau — for there shall be no further need for progress."
"Information technology and artificial intelligence are advancing day by day. Scientists and technologists are working to improve them by leaps and bounds to make it easier for mankind to do work of all kinds, focusing on minimizing human time and effort. Various technology-rich countries' technology associations are working and researching for this purpose continuously. Japan is at the top of the list of highly technology-rich countries and has already produced housekeeping and guard robots. Developers are also working on robots that can be used as waiters or workers in hotels and shopping malls, respectively. Just imagine a world where nobody has to be a servant of anyone just for the sake of making a living. Imagine that, when nobody has to get cursed by anyone just because being a servant he/she can be treated like an animal. The world would be better place if instead of humans, we make robots our servants and our workers. In my view, by 2030, Japan or another country will take a step to launch robots that will work in malls as workers and hotels as waiters. It will be adopted by other countries soon as well, as it saves time and effort that humans once had to expand. Side effects: 1. There will be fewer jobs for uneducated or illiterate people, but that does not mean they will be starving. There will be other options, of course. 2. If a robot's system crashes, it will take time to repair or money to replace; thus it could cause a loss to the organization that is running the hotel or mall. Losses can be prevented by putting sensors and exception handlers in robots. 3. Only big hotels and malls will be able to afford robots; for smaller budgets, sorry, there is no solution but to wait."
"Cellphones are no longer separate tools. Instead, chips controlled by your mind are implanted near your temple. Sound is heard through the bone, and visuals are displayed like heads-up displays through your eyes (retina). Making a call is simple. You merely think of who you need to call, and the cellular interface retrieves the number from your memory bank, or even through the Internet cloud via Wi-Fi."
"With the rise of insects as a sustainable food source globally, and almost completely replacing meat, mopane worms become globally exported and used. With a protein content of 64% (Teffo, Toms & Eloff 2007) and their size and hardiness, the worms are adopted for local production by overseas countries with an interest in insect-based food and the means to recreate their habitat. Insect reliance has increased dramatically worldwide because of insects’ low emissions, high nutrition, low cost, and space efficiency. Mopane worms, particularly dried, become an invaluable addition to diets and drive the food revolution. Locally to Southern Africa, reforestation efforts to mopane woodland occur at a rapid scale, and strict regulations are put in place to prevent over-harvesting and regional extinction. With an estimated 1.6 million kg traded within South Africa alone, and hundreds of tons exported within southern Africa, from Botswana and South Africa to Zambia and Zimbabwe in the early years of the 21st century (Toms, 2003), the worm's use increases dramatically, and it becomes a vital tool in food security for Southern Africa. The demand created locally and internationally by the worms results in job creation: harvesters, forest planters, packagers, transporters, factory workers, and more. The resulting economic growth further aids food security and improves life for people in the region. Mopane worms’ use worldwide, in conjunction with crickets and other insects, results in a more efficient, eco-friendly, and economically sustainable way of dealing with food production.Sources: Teffo, L.S., Toms, R.B., & Eloff, J.N..

"As soon as you step into the city as a tourist, you hear a gentle song welcoming you to paradise. Before your eyes is a forest of high-rise buildings, alike famous Jeddah Tower. Nearly 1 km high the tallest skyscraper in the city makes the Space Needle seem insignificant. As you step down, the passenger car retreats and two fluttering robots fly over to get information from you and play tourist guide. In front of you are flying cars, the second most popular vehicle in the city, after underground transportation. Downtown are auto restaurants, where you just sit and choose dishes, quantity, and temperature, after which your dinner will be served as soon as possible. Finally, you pay with your card and leave."
"Space is said to be the final frontier. But at $10,000 simply to put a shuttle into low-Earth orbit, the struggles seem monumental in light of the risk-reward payoff. However, after 30-odd years of construction, a 35,786 km steel cable is erected in Haro Strait, off the coast of Vancouver Island. An elaborate series of barges and docks circle the tower’s base, where pulleys and levers wait to haul precious equipment and building materials into low-Earth orbit. The ISS is the first served, with the elevator being used to shuttle supplies in and out at a fraction of the original cost. Already, tourist companies and independent industries vie for limited use of the tower. Space has never been closer."
"2030: With the reduction of global ice, Antartica reveals a wealth of untapped resources. United Nations (UN) claim governance over the continent and start utilising these resources. 2040: With the devastation caused by global warming, there is little alternative but to abandon fossil fuel options to leave Earth’s orbit. Earths dwindling resources are channeled into the construction of The International Space Elevator (ISE). 2050: With the final construction of the ISE over the southern pole of UN Antartica, efficient (fossil-fuel free) space access is achieved. Not only does the ISE revolutionise efficient non-fossil fuel space travel, it can be used to expel the unwanted greenhouse gases into space. Ultimately allowing humans to readjust earth’s greenhouse gases to safe levels, reversing the effects of climate change."
"An analytical study by PwC on the future of the financial sector describes the life of 56-year-old Anna: she starts the day aboard a high-speed train, viewing recommendations from her personal financial adviser on a built-in display in her glasses that is activated by blinking twice (authenticated by a retina scan); on the advice of a bank expert, she selects a savings scheme to fund her son's education at a flagship online university and immediately sets up an account and an auto-deposit; she also consults a robot analyst on personal investment options, and receives a tailor-made package of discounts and special offers from a range of providers. Next, the fictional Anna takes out a P2P loan, and the following day she receives business advice via video link from a financial consultant, realtor, and credit specialist who have each analyzed her behavior in social media and other websites."
"The creators of the sci-fi movie Back to the Future Part II imagined a world in 2015 teeming with hoverboards—wheel-less skateboards that hover above the ground by way of magnetic attraction. But in reality hoverboards have little prospect of becoming a daily mode of transport. As demonstrated by Lexus when it unveiled a working hoverboard in 2015, the device requires an artificially constructed surface with powerful magnets built into the asphalt or concrete.But it's too early to say goodbye to the dream of personal flying transport. Humanity can expect to see a multitude of options: from jetpacks and drones to flying cars. True, as a cross between a sports car and a light-sport aircraft, the latter will not come cheap: the estimated price is several hundred thousand euros.For those with shallower pockets, there may be more affordable options, including the above-mentioned jetpacks. Such a liquid-fueled contraption enabled James Bond to evade his pursuers in the 1965 movie Thunderball (albeit with the help of some artful film editing).Mini-jetpacks the size of a rucksack are being developed by the U.S. company JetPack Aviation. Larger fridge-sized versions weighing 200 kg are in development by Martin Aircraft Company of New Zealand. The jetpack can be operated manually or automatically and comes equipped with a parachute which should say the developers, save both the pilot and the vehicle."
"McKinsey consultants posed the question: Which professions have the highest chance of remaining in demand in 15-20 years? The study concluded that the hardest occupations to automate will be those that involve managing and training people (teaching, coaching, business training) and those that require decision-making expertise and experience and/or a creative approach (journalist, programmer, chef), as well as the ability to negotiate with suppliers or customers. Oddly enough, some low-skilled jobs are also difficult to automate: for instance, robots are not yet able to make up beds at hotels. Hotel guests are too unpredictable—you never know where they’ll put the pillow or whether they’ll leave their clothes on the bed."
"Whereas in the past people whose jobs were automated had an opportunity to retrain, now machine learning has the potential to hit all industries. Moreover, robots can adopt a variety of guises, often far removed from the familiar humanoid image found in the movies. One development trend in robotics is the construction of soft, plastic, polymer-based robots: artificial “muscles” are able to contract like the extremities of an octopus. Without bones or other rigid elements, such robots can change size and shape, stretch and twist in different directions, and wrap around objects and people without harming them. Robotization will affect the economy at all levels, liberating humans from the most tedious, monotonous tasks, such as walking around warehouses, searching high and low for goods on shelves, cleaning office premises, sowing seeds and harvesting, providing individual banking services, issuing prescription drugs, etc. Meanwhile, exoskeletons will expand people’s physical capabilities—from everyday life, where the disabled will be able to move without the aid of a wheelchair, to space exploration and defense, where soldiers in “mechanical suits” will be practically indestructible."
"The most promising industry with a view to robotization is medicine—technologies have already been developed that could replace some doctors at hospitals in future. The rise of the robots could well wipe out an entire layer of medical specialists. In June 2017, a group of psychologists and AI experts at Stanford University published the results of the tests on a chatbot therapist: it can successfully treat the symptoms of anxiety and depression and is already available to ordinary clients of psychotherapists. Many clinics already perform computerized diagnosis and use robots to assist surgeons during operations due to their accuracy and precision. In the future, machine-learning algorithms will allow computers to diagnose patients based on their medical history just as accurately as a human doctor would. In fact, the technology will let medical professionals intervene in the diagnostic process only if the computer finds deviations from the norm in analyses or x-ray shots."
"The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) opens up new avenues of development for states, primarily in the military field. For a start, we’ll see increasing numbers of unmanned vehicles, both aerial and underwater: so-called “floating drones” are already making huge waves, so to speak, in the area of military research. Command of all combat operations will be handed over to a major AI that controls other AIs lower down at the field level.The domestic version will be a “supreme AI” that controls household devices hooked into the Internet of things, including all smart-home systems, and which also takes care of family members. The Internet of things is set to be replaced by the “Internet of smart things” or the “Internet of AI brains,” whereupon hackers bent on reprogramming AI could become the bane of new technology. Not only will we have to manage everyday tasks, but also learn to defend ourselves, just as people learn to sidestep criminals and fraudsters in real life. Either way, it’s people who will remain in charge of AI-based systems.In the area of social relations, AI will become an object of research as a substitute for a human in sexual relations and as a communicative partner. The key issues here relate to AI's ability to feel emotions, as well as to lie and act irrationally. Such systems will ultimately become indistinguishable from humans, giving rise not only to multiple philosophical, ethical, and moral problems, but to new legal norms regulating interactions between people and AI, and even among the machines themselves. As foreseen by sci-fi writers, we can even expect to see the appearance of robot-rights activists campaigning for robots’ electoral and civil freedoms, as well as their right of self-determination."
"Toys will not be bought at the toy store anymore, they will also more and more rarely even delivered by the producer. Children rooms will be equipped with 3D printers. Children will create and print their own toys. If they still want to buy a well renown toy sets, they just need to access the online services provided by toys designers and activate the 3D printer. Communities of amateur and professional toys designers will also make available their own creations. The children room will be also equipped with a VR area, installed in the center or in such a way to avoid that the children will hurt themselves by hitting walls, furniture and other objects while enjoying a virtual trip. Cameras will provide extra security and enhanced security systems to monitor the children activities and prevent hacker infiltrations will be installed on all the digital devices in the environment. All the toys will be robotics and will be able to interact with the external environment or remotely with the toys of other children. Ceilings and walls will be covered by special screen projecting animated wallpaper or can be used for educational purposes (such as a homemade planetarium). A higher level of interaction will also require digital connected sport equipment, integrated with most entertainment platforms. Such children's rooms will be however a privilege for few in the heart of the main cities, due to the housing skyrocketing prices. They will, however, be common in the middle-class suburban areas and will play an essential role in remote areas, where they will also be used as e-learning stations."
"Self-driving car-sharing is a model of publictransport that will decrease the impact on the ecology by using automobiles ina more sensible and economical way as well as critically reducing the amount oftraffic jams. The concept is based on the fact that a person can order a carthat will pick them up at one place and drive to another - just like Uber - andall route optimisation, parking and logistics are governed by an IT-system.Besides, if all cars are self-driving ones, a number of accidents will decreasesince speed levels, overtakings, and distance between cars will also becontrolled by a computer. Besides, car-sharing and no driver will lower thecost of the trip. These cars will probably be ecological, for example,electric."
"Since the beginning of space exploration, tons of garbage have been threatening satellite communications and even sunlight penetration.In 2050, there is a whole infrastructure of stations in earth orbit for collecting, sorting and recycling defunct satellites and their debris. Space garbage trucks detect debris in the space nearby, collect them and bring them to the station. After being sorted, the debris is burnt in the upper atmosphere or recycled on the stations or on earth."
"Mark woke up early and went downstairs to the common room for morning neurosynchronisation. He had been living in Techno-ashram for already a year and in this time its other inhabitants started to seem more like brothers to him. Combining meditative practices with neural interfaces creates social connectivity at such a level that sometimes they called themselves Multisapiens.In the last two months since the beginning of yet another war, Mark and his colleagues had been working to create a way of neural connection that would let people better understand each other. This should be a version of the technology they are using themselves in Techno-ashram but it should have a less steep learning curve. To test this technology they are going to go to a hot spot and try to reconcile the parties of the conflict that had been unable to hear each other out for a long time.Mark had changed quite a lot in the past year. He had come here completely empty from the speed of the changes of the world around, had lost his job because of automatisation (it doesn’t matter that he’s still getting the base income - it cannot replace the illusion of meaning one gets from doing routine work in the office), tired from everything around - technology, people, governments - who seem to be racing for some illusory reward. Here, in this quiet place, there was no competition. Citizens of Techno-ashram had a different view of technological developments - not the Olympic «faster-higher-stronger» but rather a conscious use of technologies which could help with the global challenges and create a better future for the humanity.Innovations such as nano-, bio- and neuro technologies lead to new global risks that can wipe the humanity out of existence. For example, nuclear weapons only exist in a limited number of countries, marginal groups would not be able to easily obtain this kind of technology - this would require years of research and development as well as huge amounts of money. This situation is not as hopeless in terms of nuclear weapons usage since a small number of parties are more likely to negotiate and prevent an armed conflict. But new technologies, such as genome editing, make it possible to create genetically modified biological weapons, insusceptible to antibiotics, in an average university’s laboratory for a small sum which exponentially increases the number of people who can have this kind of weapon. This is available not only for terrorist organisations, but also for fanatic loners who have the necessary knowledge which can be obtained at any modern university’s genetics course. Genetically modified viruses is just one of the examples of difficult-to-control type of weapons based on new technologies. There are notions of «grey slime» - out-of-control nano robots who turn everything they see in similar nano robots which would lead to the death of all living creatures on the planet - and «green slime» - bacteria operating by the same principles. These show that a technogenic catastrophe at a planetary scale can happen by chance, out of carelessness, without any malice. Both malignant intentions and accidents could in some way be dealt with via several social formats, such as a negotiation skills or public control over technology use. It can be said then, as it seems, that the technological level of a civilisation corresponds to a certain level of its humanitarian development, but in our case the former is far ahead of the latter. Techno-ashram is a name of one out of many places where people are trying to find a solution for these and others global challenges with the help of technologies and a different life logic. Sure, it won’t solve all the problems but may help the humanity get closer to a more humane future."
"Technology will exceed the limits of von Neumann architecture. Machines will be neuromorphic, working according to the principles of a biological brain, based on impulsive neural networks but with a macro architecture selected by a human. They will be much more energy-efficient than current technologies. They won’t need an external power source and will be able to work longer by getting some energy from the environment.These devices will not be programmed, in the current sense of the word. Rather, they will be assigned specific connections.Examples: wearable personal assistants, autonomous manufacturing and delivery, artificial insects, autonomous research devices (on the ground, underwater, underground, in space). Many public management roles will be done by neuromorphic officials. People will be incredibly dependent on these beings."
"There aren’t any aboveground parking lots in the city anymore. Drivers no longer need to try to get into a small space near their home or office. It’s not a good idea to try to trick the automatic evacuators, which use a monitoring system based on low-orbit satellites.Owners of modern self-driving cars are not very inconvenienced by this — now cars can park by themselves. After passengers leave, the car logs on an online auction of available parking spaces and makes a choice according to the owner’s instructions. It can choose parking that’s nearby and, as a result, more expensive, or it can save by going to a far-off multilevel underground parking facility (additional energy expenses should also be taken into account). Owners of more archaic cars prefer not to drive them in the city center at all. Cars with traditional oil engines (in contrast to electric cars) have to pay an eco-tax when they enter the central zone. Space that was freed up by getting rid of parking has been used to expand the roads, pavements, and green zones."
"Global warming has disproportionately changed the number of temperature spikes per year. Average summer temperatures have changed by only 1 degree in the past few decades, but the number of hot days have tripled. Instead of the previous 6-8 days, now the temperature goes above 30°C 20 days a year. Inevitably, energy spending on ventilation and air conditioning increases."
"Fewer retail shops exist — there is no need anymore for big spaces full of goods. Most products and groceries are delivered straight to homes on a subscription basis by drones. An alternative is to receive your Internet purchase in a nearby shop refashioned as just another point of delivery. Cuts in rent costs plus more flexible responses from Internet sellers has lowered the prices of mass goods. Previous shopaholic’s paradises such as GUM, TSUM, and Detskyi Mir have finally become full-fledged entertainment centers"
"Traffic — this longtime problem in Moscow, with its radial and circle street structure, has all but disappeared. There are several contributing factors. Self-driving cars always maintain a minimum distance, which guarantees no human error (car accidents, those infinite Moscow-style left turns from the right lane, zigzagging from one lane to another). The city center is free only for self-driving cars of the last generation — electric cars that can talk to each other and with road infrastructure (lights, congestion controllers, tunnels, and bridges). Older cars need to pay to enter the city center beyond main highways."
"Electric cars, accounting for tax and parking benefits, have become better than regular cars. But in a big city there are difficulties — you wouldn’t try to use a cable stretching from the 17th floor to charge. This issue is solved by special connectors attached to street lampposts. The electricity is paid for through a municipal mobile app. Some especially entreprising citizens tried to steal electricity by stealthily using the connector, but a new control function took care of that, and now a charging device periodically checks the cryptographic IDs of automobile computers."
"Many schools have adopted the MOOC (massive open online course) model — like the classes at Coursera — which helped solve the problem of getting well-qualified teachers at public schools. Now students listen to star teachers either from home or in a classroom (if parents work and cannot leave a child alone in the flat), and then teachers who are not as cool help students understand the material. As a result, distance no longer makes a difference in the quality of education, and there is no need to take a child to a school that is on the other side of the city. Old-fashioned classes like PE and crafts lessons have been replaced by new ones such as 3-D modeling.There are still schools with a “classic” teaching model, but not everyone can afford them."
"Developers are pointing out industrial zones as a huge land reserve that can be used to expand the city within its current limits. Acres of abandoned spaces are quickly being transformed for the better: Old factories are replaced with modern residential areas, and whole neighborhoods with elaborate social infrastructure and business centers emerge. Special attention is paid to ecology, and city space is greatly improved by the addition of many boulevards, green embankments, and parks. Depressing territories of former factories such as ZiL (Lichachev’s factory), the Moscow Metallurgical Plant “Serp i Molot,” Trekhgornaya manufaktura, Tushino Airfield, “Grayvoronovo” industrial areas, “Lenino,” “Perovo,” Nataginskyi Zaton, the area around the Belorusskyi railway station, and other previously abandoned places have become comfortable city spaces."
"By 2050 a new network of satellites exists on the Earth’s orbit that projects ads into the atmosphere. They use solar batteries to gather the energy for such a powerful signal. Each satellite can project several images at the same time on the specific part of the sky. Now, when looking at the sky, no one is surprised to see ad slogans amongst the clouds."
Space tourism is no longer something exotic although it remains quite expensive. New noiseless technologies of space launch make it possible to build space ports within the city. In the centre of Moscow the largest space port in Europe «Gagarin» is being built and it is both a space museum and an entertainment centre. By this time there are several orbital space hotels where summits and other high-level meetings are held.
"The solution to transport problems in the growing city would be a new quadcopter taxi. It will safely transport passengers in secure capsules equipped with safety parachutes. A person in the cabin won't need to know or do anything. Autonomous system will guarantee take-off after selection and confirmation of the route, identify obstacles on the way and fly around them, and then safely land at the destination point. All quadcopters will operate from a single electronic centre and will be based on neural networks, which is why protecting against cyber attacks is an important part of their design."
"Moscow is adapting to the changing infrastructure, including new transport. The share of air and suspension transport is increasing which leads to new types of development, based on 3D structures of mutual connection. Traditional horizontal scheme is replaced by a new horizontal-vertical one.With Moscow’s expansion new experimental areas are created. For example, in order to follow the required ecological guidelines new «green» zones are used: intermediate floors with abundant vegetation, mini-parks, green roofs, winter gardens-atriums and even suspended parks with genetically modified plants which effectively clean the city air."
"Urbanists and architects have long wanted to include the whole length of the embankment into the city space and now they are finally making this dream come true. The Moskva-river is becoming an important arterial road. 39 global and local centres of city life with river ports are being created along its length. Almost the whole adjacent zone is being transformed into an infinite array of parks which makes the river the main recreational centre of the megapolis. For example, in Mnevnikovskaya poima (floodplain) there is a parliamentary centre with residential neighbourhoods, and sport centres are being built as well as a surfing-park and a dozen of other parks and gardens.The concepts of centre and periphery development differ: as the river approaches the Kremlin, the embankment becomes greener. Special attention is paid to cleaning the river from drainage: surface streams are filtered with the help of ecological islets, special flora is planted on the riverbed, and the soil on the waterside is recultivated. Besides, the Moskva-river is now connected with Yauza and Setun, and a green promenade is being constructed along the Vodootvodny Canal.Moscovites have set a date for a new city-wide holiday dedicated to the Moskva-river and organise annual celebrations of it."
"At some point, a more simple and affordable solution in the form of a new sensory organ will emerge  instead of synthetic analogue of the human body, which will be even more effective than natural organ. The developed infrastructure of the city with digital navigation devices analogous to modern GPS signal inside of the shopping centers will be useful for spatial orientation of blind people who can receive navigational information through new senses.It will also provide a basis for the development of new programs that have an effect on neural system similar to the effect of drugs and hallucinogens. It will be used as a substitute for harmful drugs and alcohol among the most progressive people, will give them the opportunity to switch to safer ""light drug"" controlled by the computer. The black market for illegal hallucinogenic products will emerge immediately - there will be no rules and restrictions."
"Increasing control over user data forms a demand for solutions that leave user data under the control of users and give access only to them. And this is realizable only in decentralized solutions. That is, the emergence of the traditional, but decentralized solutions is quite possible ( social networks, messengers and so on).In addition there will be decentralized and automated formats and protocols of interaction between people, organizations and drones. People’s involvement in the process of companies operation will be abolished/reduced significantly, most routine actions will be automated, based on predefined triggers. A simple example - financial activities of an organization will be fully automated, for example on the basis of smart contracts."
"Modern political systems with one individual being in the helm will continue to prove to be ineffective. By 2050, the system of decision-making at the state level will have been divided into two parts - automated (AI) and civil (human). Machines will make all the decisions, which implies that the human mind can’t be impartial – machines will choose contractors to avoid corruption, they will decide to start or to suspend certain projects based on their efficiency, to optimize production, scientific campuses, health care system and so on.People, in turn, will be divided into two classes - ""citizens"" and ""civilians"". The latter will just enjoy life without participation in public activities. Citizens, on the contrary, will have access to personalized information system, part of the neural network, where they will make decisions concerning the life of the state –defense expenses, construction of bridges and roads, development of interplanetary spacecraft, and so on. Every citizen will be able to invest the money received from resource extraction and other sources of GDP, as well as from taxes. To be a citizen will be considered an honor. Cyber assistants -analytics will help people - they will automate a part of processes and make decisions based on the best mathematical models."
"In the near future, more and more people will prefer robots specially designed for them to live partners. Robots will satisfy all the sexual needs of people, the need for communication and support, robots will always be around when necessary and will leave when asked. In a number of countries with high living standards robot-sexuality will lead to further decline in fertility."
"In a few years, legislation will finally create a procedure of digital memories inheritance where memories will be transferred from one relative to another. The largest social networks, carriers and file services will be obliged to give relatives a full access to stories, memories, files, records and notes."
"Cities inhabited solely by robots will emerge. They will be constructed as a prototype of the idea of colonization of other planets. People will send autonomous robots to carry out missions for humanity: robots will build towns, develop the infrastructure, everything that is necessary for mining on other planets, the products will be transported back to Earth. Sending people on these planets will be simply unprofitable and risky."
"By 2050, a new trend will have appeared: computer-free. Computers have been demonstrating their unreliability during half a century from the beginning of the millennium: from banal critical errors that cause some serious man-made disasters to the unconfidence concerning the question of who really controls the computer system. It will become fashionable to reduce the number of computer systems. The city will have computer-free zones (bars, hotels, cafes), where all electronic devices will prohibited. Human Handmade will become expensive and rare."
"People will stop buying things. They will buy a subscription to a certain standard of living - the area where a person lives, the level of cleanliness and food healthiness, the car he/she drives, the school his/her children can attend - all this will become a components that constitute this subscription to a certain living standard. That will lead to even greater class stratification.Many people will not waste time on household routine, various daily duties. Time, which has always been the most valuable resource, will become a new kind of economic relations between people. Even now people who play a key role in society or occupy high positions can’t afford to waste time walking to the grocery store. The time spent waiting in line, can be easily converted to money. Services that relieve people from daily routine tasks will emerge. They will be automated to the max and united by categories based on the quality and cost of services provided: ranging from elderly care to VIP service. All household issues will be delegated to the domestic service suppliers of different quality levels."
"Depersonalized data collect all the smart entities - from smart light bulbs to smart software platforms. Huge amounts of data about all objects, increasing technical possibilities of their fast processing + the development of data analysis including machine learning precondition the opportunities of prognostic analytics’ growth. In the future, the quality and scope of predictive analytics will be even greater, and its impact on our lives will become very significant.For now these data are fragmented, as they are collected separately by each sensor (application, device, platform) and are not combined into a context around the user, but in the future this data will be collected into unified profiles. By complementing each other, they can lead to new, more accurate conclusions.These technologies will be applied by companies interested in demand increasing. To make the user purchase a new service, it is desirable to offer it at the right time, when a person has a relevant need. In the new world of big data, Apple will make a financially interesting offer to its client rather than his bank. Just because Apple will have more data.Laws protect privacy, so that all systems will collect non-personal telemetry. However, end-user reversing won’t be a daunting task for the data owner - the more sets of user data, the more accurate is his identification.User benefits will also be actively promoted in order to justify such a massive data reading - health problems prediction, the advantages of customized services over unified ones (that are made less attractive on purpose), social benefits will be introduced.Various assistants (Siri, Alexa) will know their owners inside out. They will see the patterns (which the user is simply not aware of, because he/she is unconsciously driven by his/her desires) and anticipate the wishes of their masters. It will seem to be a kind of magic.In these circumstances, substitution of the profile data, distortion of behavior models can dramatically change the way the user interacts with the outside world, hampering his life or depriving him/her of certain opportunities. One thing is when a personal assistant understands you perfectly, and the world around us offers different benefits, another - when nobody “recognizes” you."
"The concept of privacy in a public place will vanish: if now people in the subway - it's just some people in the subway, in the nearest future, everyone will be able to see your name, place of work, age, orientation and your marital status with the help of augmented reality glasses.You may ask, ""How come, I didn’t leave anything of this on social networks?"" Consider such a situation. Suppose a member of a group of enthusiasts from the community ""Deanonymizers"" automatically reports to an open online database: ""I'm in this subway car, see 20 people at this station."" Another enthusiast in half an hour reports that the same person, that is you, was seen entering an apartment block, and so on.Thus, even if your photo cannot be found on the Internet next to your name, Deanonymizers will have the map of your movements and relocations, which sooner or later will acquire more and more details."
"The omnipresent surveillance system and face recognition in the streets of the majority of big cities will lead to a huge demand for a new product - a holographic mask - this device will distort the face  on cameras and in tracking systems, thus making the person anonymous."
"Internet will be different from what we have now. The global net is split into segments on regional and functional base. Access to the local segment will be a citizen right and essential for living, but access is strictly controlled. Authentication is required and anonymous access doesn’t exist for the „good“-net. Reputation and connections with the virtual social society are fundamental to be able to connect. Attacks on the reputation through public shaming and doxing will lead to exclusion from the net. People pay huge amounts of money when blackmailed, to stay in the net and not loose „everything“. Also criminal activities will be punished by the „disconnect“. Being dropped out of the net makes life difficult and nearly impossible. Criminal subnetworks evolve and a 2-layer society will begin to exist – the global-net and the criminal-net."
"In 2040, a huge amount of new micro-satellites will be in orbit and travelling through our solar system. This system, critical for earth and inner-solar-system communication gains new attention for satellite hackers not only to control and sniff on communication but also to abuse this system to control connected devices and the satellites itself. Base ransom to advanced ""destroy"" -focussed attacks may be possible."
"In 2050, first stations on moon and probably mars will exist. As communication is the core of current and future life, here lies also the weakness. The complexity to establish relyable and stable communication to inter-space stations is huge and is an interesting target for espionage and targeted modification of important communication packages. The one who controls the communication channels, controls the non-earth stations. Critical information such as research data can be exchanged directly into money by criminal groups by tapping the ""wires""."
"DNA has proven to be a surprisingly convenient means for information storing: it allows you to achieve such data density that magnetic or silicon carriers cannot provide. So data storage systems based on DNA are widely used as devices for a cold backup.However, they are susceptible to viruses – ordinary ones, including those influencing humans. For example, influenza virus can easily damage the storage inserting itself instead of part of the data. An attacker who wants to cause a failure in the working process of a competing company, can simply infect its employees who are in the data center with influenza or chickenpox."
"Mining is fully automated, and the presence of people at the mining enterprises is no longer the case, because it is harmful to health. Some robots extract rock from the soil, others clean it, the third control the process, the fourth guard the perimeter while the fifth transfer the purified ore outside the enterprise and deliver it to consumers.A hacker who gains access to the system can reprogram individual robots so that they take a certain percentage of the platinum ore to another, unauthorized place. This implies that robots-guards are also hacked and don’t notice the theft."
"Neural network interface will become an ideal way to create a true augmented reality. Consequently, many casual everyday things will lose their value: people will make do with minimalist interiors and simple things. Only the quality of information flows, to which a person will be connected, will retain significance. Due to the fact that all information can be easily copied, piracy will flourish again, hacktivists will organize attacks on corporations that create rare, expensive and high-quality information flows for the rich. This information flows will contain preferences, interiors, entertainment, travel information, artificial intelligence, etc.At the same time, there will be menaces of the use of neuralcomputer interface: unintentional failures leading to death, prohibited programs for those who want to commit suicide, manipulative programs influencing the decision-making process, unwanted advertising, fishing, and others."
"Massive threats to personal computers will become irrelevant. Most programs will be developed by a small group of large corporations who will take control of not only devices and operating systems, which they design by themselves, but also the entire range of programs for the average user. This will prevent the emergence of a free and uncontrolled market-circulating of third-party program developers and eliminate the possibility of installing malicious code. Freelance programmers are rare enthusiasts barely able to earn a living. Computer attacks won’t disappear, but they will be much more complicated and expensive. It will become more difficult to “infect” a naive user will a virus, but easy to cheat him using fishing or advertising of a fake product. Brand new fields, such as neural network security, will emerge.Former anti-virus companies will continue to provide security, operating under the same brand names, but their products and services will no longer be visible. Security technologies will be implemented in virtually all things by default: from individual chips to urban management systems. In most cases, these security systems will be hidden from the public eye."
"Some operations can be easily carried out in one direction, but they are very difficult to reverse. For example, an image can be quickly transformed into a puzzle, but to arrange all the pieces in order to turn the puzzle back into the picture – that’s much longer, both for humans and for computers. Another example - to multiply two large numbers -a trivial task for a computer - but we don’t know how to “unmultiply” this big number and single out multipliers.Modern public key cryptography is based on this principle. To draw an analogy: I know two numbers, I have multiplied them and told everyone the result. Now everyone can encrypt a message for me using the result of multiplication, but only I can decipher this using multipliers. Cryptography is widely used in almost all spheres of human activity. It is no exaggeration to say that the world will go through a huge shock if suddenly all that is encrypted suddenly becomes decrypted.The surprise is that there are already quantum computers that allow you to quickly solve problems that seem to be back-breaking for conventional computers, for example, to quickly decompose a composite number. The only obstacle to the digital end of the world (let's call it Cryptoapocalypse) is that for the time being quantum computers can work with small numbers only.But the day will soon come when security services or rich villains will access a universal decryption and do terrible things. For example, if such a villain steals your credit card, then he will immediately recognize its pin. In addition, the ability to decipher brings along the ability to forge. For example, an ATM informs the bank that thousand dollars was withdrawn, but the villain falsified the message so that it says that only one dollar has been withdrawn.Another thing that encryption gives us is identifiability. Encryption allows you to be sure that you have entered the actual bank's website, not a fake one.And that's half the trouble. Even when the first supervillains appear, the world will continue to use the same algorithms for a long time. Quick shift to new safety standards is not the strongest point of humanity."
"Unmanned machines are used not only as transportation but also as a platform for negotiations - in order to accelerate the pace of life and not to lose a second. They have enough comfort and safety due to multiple cameras, lidars and radars. An attacker can hack this unmanned machine and gain access to its various systems, including inside cameras - and steal the record of negotiations.Alternative: ransom for your life during the ride. That is, you're going inside a car, and attackers tell you via the radio - pay now or you’ll bump into a pole."
"Now the military have electromagnetic weapons at their disposal, generating momentum and disabling enemy electronics. Military electronics in turn often has protection from EMI, which is not applicable to civil devices.The day is not far off when the EM gun will be constructed in a compact ""personal"" form, but with a large radius of destruction (10-100 meters). Imagine what possibilities such weapons open up to cyber hooligans in the ""smart city"" of the future. After pressing the button in his pocket, the attacker (or a terrorist) will disable (temporarily or permanently) all surveillance cameras in the area, traffic lights, smartphones, augmented reality glasses and electronic parts of our future bodies.Meanwhile, hooligans and specialists have access only to cell phones jammers and other such “interference” generators."
"In 2050, our mind can be ""uploaded"" after death. We won’t be immortal, but our mind, knowledge and experience will feed in to the future internet. This may bring the old ""body stealing for medical research"" to a new level, where these minds could be stolen or deleted if ransom is not paid by the relatives."
"Education has finally switched to a remote mode - no longer need you to attend school. Now every student  switches on a hologram of a teacher at home (or in park, as she/he prefers) at the designated time. Attendance is monitored: if the hologram is inactive, or a student does not interact with it, he/she is reprimanded, and parents receive the notification that their child has skipped the class.After having hacked the system, students learned to replace the data about their activities - the school receives the information that a student has been diligently attending lectures and participating actively in all the discussions, whereas in fact he/she watches videos instead of the teacher’s hologram. Sometimes students add horns or ears to the holographic teacher – just for kicks."
"Exoskeletons, advanced implants and prosthetics are common and advance humans in many ways, such as physical power, extended functionality and compensating weaknesses. As all of these technologies will be connected, meant for the good, criminals abuse the control mechanisms to control humans to their needs - think of a puppet master."
"Armed conflicts will gradually shift to the opposition between human-controlled robots (air, land and water drones). Although wars will be fought over territory controlled by the people, casualties will be minimized. In case the territory is taken over, the population can be displaced by remotely controlled machines. These machines will operate autonomously, as the problem of determining the intentions of man and a reliable identification of an ally or an enemy will remain unresolved. Less developed countries that won’t have enough money to afford any means of protection against intervention by machines won’t be able to make a stand against the enemy. However, life in the state of war will give to many of the inhabitants of these countries and territories a nudge to find and use weaknesses in the machines. Over time, this fight will transform from physical confrontation into the warfare of intelligence. Vulnerabilities in the system will lead to the theft of documents and instructions enabling management and describing the structure of robots, which will open up the possibility of taking control over someone’s army."
"The development of specialized (designed for one task, for example, a robot-deliveryman, a robot -cleaner) systems, autopilots, etc. will sweep away a number of existing professions (drivers, equipment operators and so on). This will lead to the emergence of a robot as the subject of independent economic activities. Robots will be produced with a specific purpose (eg robotaxi), and then it will continue to operate in economically autonomous way (offering their services, depending on supply and demand), sending just a part of income to its creator if necessary."
"Many cities, or at least their central regions, will contain areas without human drivers. People will be barred from entering these areas inside their own transport. They won’t have road signs, traffic lights, markings, but there will be new devices - beacons in case an emergency shutdown of the central system should occur, synchronizing the movement of controlled robot vehicles. In this case, vehicles will be able to make decisions independently reducing their speed to a safe level. This architecture will allow to tackle effectively possible attacks on the central control system. In such areas the problem of traffic congestion will be solved completely, which will make the idea very popular in different countries."
"People have now the option to improve their bodies by purchasing upgrades in shops — strength, agility, endurance, or the ability to interact with the Internet of things without wires and touches (neuron interfaces). But the main challenge will be improving the human brain. Indeed, high intelligence and the ability to make the right strategic decisions is not favorable to any of the existing political systems. Therefore, the chances are that the augmentation of features like IQ, memory, logical thinking, physical ability for self-learning or training won’t be available to everyone. The main threat is that such an access to self-upgrades can literally take people very quickly to a new stage, setting them apart from the rest of humanity in terms of mental capacity, morality, and other aspects, just as we are different from apes in terms of our mental abilities."
"Countries that form communities and unions (such as the remains of the European Union), will try to solve the problem of illegal migrants through labeling legal citizens and taking control over the movement of people in public places. This will reduce the number of crimes committed in public places, but will create clandestine camp areas inhabited by such migrants. Also there will be black market of stolen and forged labels that people will learn to hand over."
"People’s lifestyle is becoming more mobile, which leads to the development of technologies for remote sex: each partner has its own set of devices, and these devices communicate with each other via the Internet. The partners put on a kind of suits with sensors and stimulators and virtual reality helmets if they want to have sex. They can configure the environment and movements according to their preferences.An attacker who acts according to the scheme ""a man in the middle"" can intercept data sent between the partners, and replace it, forcing one partner to take part in BDSM-show or something even more brutal. In this case, the attacker records the data stream and can then blackmail his victims threatening to put their ""dirty"" sex on display on the Internet."
"Using augmented reality devices (initially, these are glasses, contact lenses, then a variety of implants, supplementing natural senses) mankind will turn the world into a place much more saturated with information.Many old problems will stay in the past. You can’t remember the name and position of all colleagues? The system will help. You don’t know how to use a new device? Just follow the prompts in front of your eyes. Have faced an inscription in an unknown language? No problems.Although augmented reality opens up a lot of opportunities, it also inflicts a lot of risks, both social and technical.It will be more difficult to hide from annoying ads that will become personalized, addressing you by your name – because you can’t turn off the implant. And if a perpetrator gains control over your augmented reality, you will fall into his hands. You simply won’t notice your money flow away from your bank account, or you will cross the street on a green light not knowing that actually the light is red.Smart contact lense will change the way how humans access virtual and real spaces via augmented reality. Not only may attackers try to „kill“ the functionality of lenses to „kick out“ people from the future internet, but also manipulating the sight, so that other crime may be invisible or the behavior of people change. A thief or murder being invisible by the people around or even manipulating people to do a wrong step which leads to death could become a risk."
"Electricity consumers located in the same apartment or belonging to the same owner can exchange the energy accumulated in their batteries through direct communication with each other. For example, at some point, it may be more efficient to spend the energy accumulated in the car battery, rather than to involve the electrical grid. A ""Smart House"" is requesting permission from a parked car, which, in turn, consults its owner’s electronic calendar: what amount of electricity should be left in reserve if any trips are planned for today?"
"Maintaining optimal weight and staying in excellent physical shape is not difficult. In each case there is a suitable effective pill. Therefore, biotechnology could mean sports equipment will live on only in the collections of its most zealous fans.With regards to physical exercise, virtual reality really liven things up. It adds an element of fun and socialising to working out. For example, you are not just training on your home rowing machine, now you are speeding downstream on the raging Amazon river. No more tediously pumping biceps and calf muscles, you are climbing the steep basalt cliffs of Trout Creek together with your friends. And all this - without leaving home!"
"In a way, the home interior returns to the past of a century before. Like in the 1950s, the space of the apartment is not cluttered with a huge number of appliances. This, of course, does not mean that there is no equipment at all. This just means that all appliances are hidden, almost invisible to a person. Robots are set to the most discreet mode: they work when nobody is home, or choose those areas of the apartment where these fussy assistants won’t be seen.There is a retro trend in industrial and interior design, that turns the appearance of modern devices and appliances into those of ‘the good old days’, so close to our heart."
"Those, who love frequent changes of setting and decor have a chance to change their view of things, literally speaking. Although the interior itself is without any frills, with simple colours and textures, special active contact lenses broadcast augmented reality images of rooms directly on the retina, so that the apartment effortlessly transforms into a luxury French rococo interior characteristic of Louis XIV era, or to a trendy eco-friendly high-tech living space, all in the blink of an eye."
"Armchairs, chairs, sofas - any piece of furniture is able to adapt to the shape of your body and become perfectly comfortable. Personal profiles, which contain parameters of house residents, can be stored in the memory of furniture or be scanned every time by the system.Special attention is given to bed configuration. Before going to bed, you can adjust the level of hardness and temperature of its surface, as well as texture, colour and fabric decor - everything needed to rest and get a good night’s sleep."
"It is not necessary to go out and choose a convenient place to meet up with friends, chat and have a cup of coffee. Almost every apartment has a cozy corner with equipment that allows you to receive and broadcast full-size 3D-holograms of your interlocutors. All that you need is to agree on a meeting time and take care to protect the confidential data being transmitted.Hindrances to communication and meetings  are dramatically reduced, as are the reasons to leave the comfort and near-perfect world inside your own apartment."
"Technological development is following the path of man’s liberation from ""domestic slavery”. A Robot-chef prepares your meal with the help of devices such as a 3D-print-microwave. It also orders food from stores daily or weekly following a list that you have previously compiled. Cleaning duties rest with mini-drones: they not only collect dust and litter, but also carry out hygienic UV treatment of kitchen countertops, the bathroom and toilet.The abundance of technology with elements of artificial intelligence does not confuse anyone. The entire ""team"" of personal household robots is thoroughly tested by manufacturers and service companies in terms of protection from external cyber attacks. The more home robots you have, the more opportunities you have to focus on the “human” side of your existence."
"Cities with complete recycling are built throughout the world. They use the energy of the sun, wind, water, and process human waste. They fit into the natural landscape and don’t cause harm to the environment. Technologies, which were created in the early 21 century, beginning with Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates, are now refined and used everywhere. It has completely changed the principle of human interaction with the environment, and benefited the countryside around cities, which no longer experience enormous ecological pressure"
"Film directors successfully experiment with showing their films on multiplanar, kinetic screens, consisting of millions of pulsing cube-pixels. Their movement is subject to the plot of the film, sound and the projected image, creating an additional artistic effect. This can be called a creative genre mixture - film and contemporary dynamic installation."
"Astronauts on board the ISS have been tapping into the opportunity to obtain regenerated water for a long time - for example, from vapours and waste. The European Space Agency has gone several steps further further and offered the much-improved Melissa system - an alternative micro-ecological life-support system. It is designed to process each and every gram of human waste, turning it into oxygen, water and food. The most obvious goal is to save on the delivery of water and necessary products to the orbit. But the most important task of a closed artificial ecosystem development is preparation for long-term space missions: A flight to Mars, or a prolonged stay on the moon."
"For those who do not want to bother with cooking and consider it a waste of time, there is an alternative option. Photosynthetic algae symbionts, which provide humans with most of their required nutrients, are implanted under the skin. Since people produce heat, regardless of the time of year and temperature on the street, they can produce food under their own skin all year round, combining a farm and a restaurant inside themselves, easily and effortlessly!"
"After being asked what to do with a rapidly growing population of jellyfish in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, the UN answered in a very non-standard way: ""Eat them!"". Especially because some species of jellyfish have been on the menu for hundred years in China. Scientists, for their part, help to promote unusual food markets in every possible way, because jellyfish have so many amazing properties. For example, jellyfish protein, recreated in the laboratory will glow if influenced externally, just like its prototype. So pasta, cake or ice cream which contain this substance starts to shine as soon as you begin eating."
"Following several unsuccessful attempts, the International oceanic station has opened. Just like the ISS (a space environment research laboratory), it becomes a global research centre for the study of the sea and finding more efficient ways to combat environmental disasters. The Ocean Station structure is quite reminiscent of an ordinary village: there is a residential unit, a farm to grow plants and fish, scientific modules and a floating power station that produces energy from sunlight and the wind and the movement of waves. To ensure its effective operation, scientists have designed a purpose-made single cable that combines electrical wiring, a water pipeline, an air-conditioning system and data transferring structures (of course, protected!).The Ocean Station takes on the aesthetics of a living organism: it can change its configuration depending on weather conditions - it shrinks in order to avoid being torn apart by the waves and the wind, or it expands in different directions, giving more space for seaweed or fish farming.Open Sailing, a scientific community that is based at the station, conducts research in different areas. For example, it constructs robotic mechanisms for getting rid of contaminants in the ocean, it engineers mobile aquaculture to maintain long-term support for human life at sea and looks for new alternative sources of energy. It also develops global standards for purely civilian Internet, moderated only by its users, not governments, businessmen or the military. After all, the idea of freedom and independence is equally close to the global Internet as the vast expanses of the world's oceans!"
"Music is not immune to progress. It develops and undoubtedly becomes richer and more diverse due to modern technologies. New musical instruments serve as the most illustrative example. For example, following the laser harp, laser beams are used in other instruments. The principle of their operation is similar to regular strings, but their sound is produced not by plucking, but by blocking. A laser violin or a laser bass can operate as an independent MIDI-controller, generating an unusual timbre or synthesised sound. Even a novice will be met by a great tornado of applause due to the visual effects of this musical laser show.Another strong trend is a touch-screen control panel. For example, to play the contactless piano, it suffices to make a few exquisite virtuoso movements in the air. A special interactive platform identifies the motion of a musician and plays the corresponding notes. The guitar fretboard doesn’t have strings either, but there is a panel with the possibility to quickly change settings and playing modes (for example, 6-string and 12-string guitar).Biophysical musical instruments are taking over ‘body music’. Special sensors and programs are connected to the musician and can capture and amplify sounds produced by human muscles.However, despite this progress, Stradivarius violins’ continue to increase in value with each passing year."
"Medicine has always been crucial to the success of a society. And society has always sought to streamline the health care work flow. Adaptive intelligent medical complexes (Trans-Pital) represent another step towards common sense. These hospitals are not rigid constructions, designed to stay in one configuration permanently – they adapt to the needs of a particular community at a particular period of time. Trans-Pitals consist of mobile cubic modules, which can be moved within the complex, depending on the situation. They can form various structural subdivisions (ambulatory, hospital, emergency assistance, etc.), or, conversely, they can shut down their usual operations and transform into recreational space if there are few patients.The decision on transformation is made by an intelligent system that has access to information about the health condition of all the inhabitants who reside in the surrounding areas. Statistics and medical data are under the strict control of cyber security systems - we are talking about the health and safety of the entire district!"
"Compact and portable electronics, are extremely popular. To solve the main problem of constant battery energy consumption, scientists have found a way to charge batteries literally on the move.Clothing and accessories are made of sufficiently strong and flexible fabric that is able to generate energy when people move. This amount of energy is enough to maintain the operation of several portable electronic devices. Different types of textiles use different ways to produce energy: ""solar"" textiles with photocells are charged by light, piezoelectric ones convert kinetic energy, which is a result of stretching, twisting and friction during movement. Who would have thought that a backpack straps’ wiggling can be such a benefit?"
"The fact that shape and colour can strongly influence human emotions has long been well-known. Now this knowledge has been adopted by clothing and interior designers, who use scientific psychotextiles in everyday life. These are knitted fabrics with purpose-made electrochromic composite yarns. They can literally be programmed to change colour and pattern to directly affect a person's mood - create a party atmosphere, or, conversely, a tranquil one. It is becoming a kind of ""visual medicine,"" an alternative to antidepressants.Psychotextiles’ ‘behaviour’ can be adjusted to almost any event - a change in weather, a change of seasons and time of day, etc. Distinct stylistic directions associated with these technological possibilities are appearing in art, design and architecture."
"It becomes fashionable to have one’s own intellectual drone that functions as a personal assistant. It always follows the owner at a comfortable distance, can take pictures and shoot videos, send and receive personal e-mail, call the police or a doctor if the owner is in danger, or function as a courier.Personal drones accumulate a lot of confidential information and are able to influence the physical security of their owners, meaning people should be encouraged to pay special and very close attention to the cyber defence system of their intelligent drones."
"Dikson is the northernmost town in Russia, located on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. It has a harsh climate and few residents. But the world is changing. Global warming will inevitably lead to the active development of the Arctic region. A small settlement, divided by a strait, half a kilometre long, is turning into a modern, comfortable city with a multi-functional port.There are residential and public spaces with large green areas for leisure activities. The project taps into natural and artificial lighting, as the polar night in this region lasts three and a half months. The operation of the complex is supported, largely, by the energy of the tides and wind. To solve the problem of fresh water, desalination plants and rainwater collection systems are used."
"The unexpected Aurora in Chernobyl – that is the name given by architects to the glowing skyscraper made of units that can clean the air and water by absorbing radiation. The concept behind the design was to pay respect to the tragic events of 1986 and to build a well-protected home for the residents of the area where the disaster occurred. Needless to say, that security, including cyber security. Indeed it was the the main concern of the engineers who design and monitor this unusual residence in this unusual place."
"The ""Bio-pyramid"", an unusual architectural, cultural and environmental project, is being set up in Egypt. Ancient buildings in Giza are complemented by a transparent dome in the ""eco-tech"" style. Inside, a special microclimate is created, which allows this parched piece of desert to turn green once again. In addition to the biosphere complex, the domed neo-pyramid also houses a museum and acultural and tourist centre."
"The idea of placing the airport as close as possible to the business centre of London had been in the mind of architects since the 30s of XX century. After 100 years, this bold idea has become a reality. New London Britannia Airport was built in the Thames estuary.The terminals are placed on giant floating platforms and connected via underwater tunnels. A unique feature of the project is that most of the energy required is generated by water turbines, located in the immediate vicinity of the floating runways. Because of its proximity to the centre of a populous city, a special emphasis is placed on airport security systems, first of all - the protection of intelligent control systems."
"Finally, pseudo-3D glasses and the ridiculous illusion that has passed for a three-dimensional image on a flat screen are sinking into oblivion. Now, you don’t need to agree on a compromise in order to watch a film with realistic three-dimensional images. The movie industry is enriched with filming technologies and holograms. High technologies are awaiting the new breed of Camerons."
"Food can not only be consumed, but also inhaled. Devices that allow food to be sprayed (especially in liquid form) by ultrasound, turning it into a mist are becoming incredibly popular. You need only take a tube and inhale the course - main or dessert. This form allows to taste all ingredients and the entire meal at the same time. Furthermore, calories are consumed more slowly."
"Carbon fibre, more lightweight, durable and resilient than aluminium and steel, is widely used in aircraft. This enables fuel economy and a great degree of freedom in design.An ordinarily narrow fuselage becomes more voluminous and curved to enhance streamlining, greater passenger comfort and technical convenience. Reliable engines do not require constant monitoring, so it is better to partially embed them in the body. Wings are made longer and thinner to reduce drag and, once again, to save fuel. The back of the aircraft models becomes U-shaped, acting as a shield for the engines and reducing their noise.Lightweight composite materials make it possible to use more environmentally friendly forms of energy. Aircraft with engines that are powered exclusively by solar panels located on their wings are no longer a rarity."
"Technology will become so widespread, and most importantly - affordable, cheap and fast that the majority of eateries and cafes will exist in the format of automatic machines equipped with 3D-printers.The scope of this technology will enable the user to cook a dish from any cuisine in a few minutes, and fast food will no longer be synonymous with a bad meal. The user chooses the dish and ingredients he or she would like, with the option of adding further flavours to make it individual. At the same time, food cooked with the help of 3D-printers maintains the proper balance of vitamins, nutrients and minerals, and does not contain harmful additives."
"Almost every inhabitant of the Earth has at least one biotech implant or implanted microchip. Computers, and Google Glass are now the size of contact lenses. Now, to find a necessary media file, it is enough to blink, a playback function is available directly to visual and auditory nerves. This opens up broad prospects not only in entertainment, but also in education, information exchange and business."
"Teachers are no longer required, they will be replaced by training course designers: in the future, the focus will shift from general education to a targeted one. This means that coaches will be in demand - targeted training experts on a specific request or problem, as well as employees of 'education camps', where the learning process goes in the ""field""."
"Wealthy corporations and wealthy citizens are buying up the world's ocean areas to create their own island states in international waters. Traveling the world, you can easily encounter the enlightened monarchy of King Andre and Queen Steffi, whose coat of arms contains a tennis racket. Or, buy a flag with an instantly recognisable apple on it as a souvenir from a new country. However, not everyone wanting to visit this state can get a visa."
"The Psychological and physiological issues facing long-term space flight are resolved, the same is true for life-sustaining measures in an emergency, when professional medical assistance cannot be provided quickly.A state wherethe body of a living being preserves its vital functions with the slowing down or even suspension of life processes, and most importantly – the possibility to come back from this condition – is called suspended animation. Now a person can be in a state of induced hibernation, or suspended animation as long as necessary.To achieve this, the body is cooled and drained of its blood which is subsequently replaced with chilled saline solution."
"Global marine fish stocks have almost given out. This has happened because of  constant overfishing and environmental degradation especially in places of spawning.Although it is a big problem, it is not irreversible. World renowned scientists believe that its solution lies in the consolidation of fish farms and a temporary ban on any commercial fishing. Warships of developed countries patrol the world's oceans to prevent industrial-scale fishing.People have witnessed the emergence of a series of ""gaps"" in the food chain, which has resulted in the rapid decline in the population of marine mammals and birds. Some of them are dying out, many are migrating to the Arctic and Antarctic regions, as well as in the equatorial regions, where they still can find food.The illegal network of fish suppliers and fisheries is rapidly growing. The police and armed forces of seafaring nations are making concerted efforts to fight against poachers and illegal sellers."
"Algae is used as raw materials for biofuel. This has freed up arable land that was previously used to grow raw materials for biofuels. Moreover, power provided by certain algae types is several times higher than that of land plants from which fuel was produced in the past."
"A fully-fledged bidirectional brain-computer interface is becoming the dominant system for an efficient information exchange between the human brain and any electronic device. Its most common implementation is in the form of an implantable chip that uses biofeedback.These conditions have paved the way for the internet revolution. NeuroNet covers completely the whole area of communications. But this transition to new technologies has brought new threats with it. People are now dealing with concerns about a greater cyber safety risk that now, not only challenges personal privacy, but also the very the preservation of human identity and protection of the individual against external control.The biggest fear of modern web users is neurohacking, that is, the spread of specific viruses through the network, and sometimes even direct NeuroNet hacking that inflicts harm on the human body. Information security is increasingly becoming a matter of life and death."
"New Zealand became the first country in the world to accomplish a total zoological ""reset"". That is, biocoenosis was returned to its original state - before the appearance of the white man.All invasive species of plants and animals were eliminated leaving only the native. Millions of European sparrows, deer, ferrets, Australian possums and Asian rats were disposed of quickly and painlessly by affecting the genome of these species.Again New Zealand is a country of indigenous birds, arthropods, and a plant kingdom found nowhere else in the world."
"The Arctic region is the most sensitive to global warming – its temperature is rising two times faster than elsewhere in the world. The ""Ice cap"" of the Earth is melting rapidly, and by the middle of the XXI century, water expanses of the Arctic are almost free of ice in summer. This certainly opens up exciting prospects for military and commercial fleets. Light yachts, sailboats and even surfers are also actively exploring these  newly-accessible areas for recreation."
"Never before in the history of mankind has the role of energy from renewable sources been so crucial. 30 % of global electrical energy is ""clean"" and produced by sun, wind, tide and other renewable sources, yet it remains at an experimental stage.Investments in the development of new sources of ""clean"" energy and modernisation of those already known amount to nearly $ 400 billion. Due to this, harmful emissions have been reduced by 1.1 billion tons per year, and emissions continue to fall.The desire of mankind for renewable “clean” energy has caused 139 countries to switch to renewable energy sources by 2050, Russia being among them. The demand for energy in all 139 countries is supplied by a wide range of technical solutions: 19.4% - wind farms, 12.9% - sea wind farms, more than 60% - various types of solar stations and power plants, hydropower plants account for about 5%, geothermal, wave and tidal stations make up 2%. Bio-generation stations are not taken into account, because they use biofuels that produce some waste and occupy vast areas as well.However, the world still comes up against a tough decision as to whether to continue to use nuclear power plants and power stations based on nuclear fusion or not as they cannot be called completely safe."
"We draw people with different printed limbs.Three-dimensional printing has proved to be a real breakthrough in medicine: you can create almost any organ required for transplantation using a 3D-printer. This has reduced the price greatly and made complex operations available to the public, as well made shortages of organs and waits for donors a thing of the past."
"Classes, home assignments and marks - all these belong to the distant past. Now school is a place where you can have fun and socialise with your peers. Finally, every students’ dream has come true: distance learning in many disciplines. Therefore, everyone can acquire a knowledge of physics or biology while sitting under a tree in the park, or brushing one’s teeth in the bathroom. The focus of education has shifted from multiplication and verification of specific knowledge to critical and independent thinking, multi-level problem solving and innovation skills. As for the ability to interact and work in a team, there are study groups of schoolchildren who are faced with a specific task, for example, to create a model of a worm in virtual reality. There, it is not so much the result, but the process itself that matters."
"The world has come up against an unexpected problem. According to doctors, the global spread of myopia has all the characteristics of a pandemic.In 2050, myopia affects at least 49.8% of the world population - or nearly 5 billion people in absolute terms.In addition, 1 billion people are projected to have a high degree of myopia, retinal detachment threatening a complete loss of vision. The reason for the spread of myopia is a constant eye concentration on nearby objects, including monitors, especially ones that are located on contact lenses. Myopia prevention is simple - go out more often (or at least stand at the window) and look into the distance.Now a small myopia (1-1.5 diopters) is considered normal. At the same time, the methods for myopia treatment are multiplying with laser correction prevailing - for the time being, it is a cheap procedure carried out by a robot surgeon in a couple of minutes. However, eyeglasses and lenses are still in demand due to the fact that new models not only contain the function of automatic sight adjustment, but also give their owner the ability to see the infrared and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum (i.e., it is also a night vision device). As for contact lenses, there is no need to worry about removing them. They can stay attached to the cornea for years, also performing a function of protection."
The development of nanotechnology has allowed the passengers of a completely opaque car to see everything that is going on outside. The material of the cars’ body panels is made of millions of tiny nano-cameras. They broadcast video which looks incredibly realistic thanks to a very high resolution.
"Globalisation makes long-distance travel a daily occurrence. This means that vehicle manufacturers are focused on increasing speed. In particular, civil aviation breaks all records: in 2050, a New York - Tokyo flight aboard a supersonic aircraft will take three hours. This airliner is completely devoid of windows and has disproportionately small wings shifted to the rear - yet, it covers the skies at extreme speeds."
"Artificial insemination will become more available and safer for women. Also, the conception and birth of a healthy baby will be guaranteed. Such a forecast was made by experts on reproductive behaviour at Stanford University (USA). For this reason, sex will lose its reproductive function, and the social and hedonic sides of life will be emphasised."
"""When are you going to have children? Don't leave it too long – time is ticking away, "" - by 2050, this phrase will be laughable. According to American reproduction experts, modern technology will enable men and women of childbearing age to freeze their ova and sperm and then undergo a sterilisation procedure. Now you can easily build a career, improve your lifestyle, seek out your partner and have children when both of you are ready for this.This begs the question: what will it be like to have a society where 45-50 –year-old ""young parents"" are bringing up young children? Maybe over the course of time we will get used to it and consider it normal. After all, 100 years ago, women aged 17-18 and sometimes younger were commonly having babies. The age of 35 was not considered to be ‘youth’."
"Just as the older generation could not get used to the fact that treatment and prosthetic reconstruction can be quite painless, women will no longer fear pain during birth by 2050. There have already been attempts to apply anaesthesia, however, patients and doctors themselves were not sure of its complete safety. By 2050, a special microchip implantation procedure for women in labor will relieve their pain during childbirth. The microchip is less than a millimetre in size , but it adapts to the patient's level of pain and relieves it."
"Despite the fact that the planet is home to more than 10 billion people, the question of overpopulation has been successfully resolved. Megapolises have been built on the ocean surface. There are drifting apartment complexes as well as stationary ones. These have been brought about by modern construction techniques. Fresh air and sea breezes are at your disposal all day long.But underwater houses and hotels are the most in demand. To fall asleep to steady swaying seaweed and counting not sheep, but fish helps to relieve stress and achieve inner harmony."
"We draw a football match between people robotsCybernetic athletes have mastered not only simple (running, jumping), but also challenging team sports that require interaction with each other. In this case we are talking about full autonomy: robots are not controlled by man and make their own decisions. By 2050, there is a watershed event: a team of humanoid robots wins over the reigning human football world champions."
"Cities are comprised of multifunctional skyscrapers, each of which is a full-fledged settlement its own right. On some floors, factories operate, on others, offices can be found, there is a room for shops, entertainment centres, and educational institutions - all in addition to residential areas. People can lead a full life for years without ever leaving the building."
"No matter how great the temptation to delegate responsibilities related to global problems to artificial intelligence may be, not all are willing to accept such a fundamental change in the political landscape. On the one hand, AI is completely trusted to exert control over agriculture, mining, industry and energy production. This is justified: it provides maximum efficiency and minimises environmental risks. Just perfect ministers! However, more advanced roles still rest in the hands of people. After all, no one can guarantee that the éminence grise with very human ambitions (and their inherent flaws)is not controlling the artificial intelligence minister. Ultimately, what is humanity worth if it is unable to answer the question ""To be or not to be?"" on its own."
"We draw a municipal building, which, when clicked, shows an e-government server.Gradually, the trajectory of the global political and economic system is changing: from concerns over the shortage of global resources to the imminent threat of environmental catastrophe and its consequences. People come to an understanding that humanity is on the verge of a tremendous crisis. Technological and ecological changes take place so quickly that politics and economics just don’t manage to keep pace with it. It is possible to survive in these conditions though, but only if  you have restructured yourself in a dramatic way. This also applies to business corporations and governments.The development of artificial intelligence and robotics gives some hope to make this crisis more controllable. Human-like AI was previously used in government for the purposes of strategic planning. Now it is faced with the task of helping govern countries. These unique artificial beings have proven to be an integral part of the new world. They are devoid of selfishness, emotions and prejudices, free from the influence of lobbyists, but possess incomparably greater insights and foresights than an ordinary person. So why not let AI control states if it is smarter than any of the presidential candidates? In that case, humanity should ensure that the AI president won’t become an obedient puppet in the hands of unscrupulous politicians who use it as a cyber weapon."
"Scientists have found a way to increase the speed of thought, which means that we won’t make bad decisions or panic and freeze in a stressful situation. It was made possible due to a combination of advanced nano-technology and the achievements of neuroscientists.They have worked tirelessly and ingeniously to create artificial synapses composed of carbon nanotubes, which reproduce the function of biological synapses in the human nervous system. Their small size allows them to be embedded in the human brain, where they exponentially increase the transmission speed of impulses between nerve cells, thereby enlarging our brains’ capacity for data analysis and decision-making processes.However, there is one concern: if our brain activity can be changed, would it be the first step towards the creation of controlled humanoid robots? And who in this case will take care of our cybersecurity?"
"Rail transport has long been the undisputed leader in terms of passenger and cargo transportation, but about a hundred years ago, it began to be replaced by cars and airplanes. Now trains have taken the lead again, due to significant increases in speed and coverage area, people are more likely to give them preferences a means of getting from A to B. In addition, the growth of mega-cities has made railways absolutely indispensable for commuting suburban residents. Besides, trains have become much safer as they are controlled by a supercomputer that has reliable protection against cyber attacks and covers the entire rail network. Trains are propelled by alternative energy sources and an electromagnetic field."
"Instead of ready-made clothing and footwear, manufacturers sell ""semi-finished"" products: A model design for a 3D-printer. Buying this model, the customer chooses the appropriate size, colour, pattern, and the presence or absence of additional details. All that remains to be done is to load a model into a special 3D-printer for clothes - and, voila! You can print out a new suit."
"Semisynthetic composition capable of regeneration within a few hours is only one of the possibilities of protocell application.Having mixed several types protocells, manufacturers began to receive materials with unusual properties that are used, for example, to produce 3D-sneakers. These shoes will never wear out, because every night the cells are restored while the shoes are charging.Running shoes have exactly the same shape as the foot and resemble a second skin. While running, they  respond to the pressure and features of the relief and provide buffering."
"Just a few decades ago, a holiday on a hot beach was the highlight of the year for many people, but now underwater travel has caught on. So much beauty can be observed during these underwater adventures: the Great Barrier Reef, the Mariana Trench, countless schools of exotic fish, whales and deep-sea squids, the migration of lobsters to name but a handful. The itinerary and duration of a journey can be selected by the individual. What was once available only to a lucky few experts can now can be seen by everyone. Finally, holidays have become truly unforgettable thanks to underwater hotel liners."
"Genetically modified algae, which can accumulate useful elements in their tissues ,have been created. Rhythmically swaying, vast expanses of fields radiate a golden glow from deep below the surface of the water - it's time to harvest gold-bearing algae. This will be carried out by special robots, which will deliver the algae to floating platforms for further processing. The process is fully automated and requires little or no human intervention.Manufacturing waste will be used to create environmentally friendly fossil fuel. It’s a waste-free process that maintains harmony between humans and nature."
"Climate change gives an unexpectedly powerful impetus to the development of Siberia. Especially for agriculture. The Northern climatic border of crops growing moves a distance of 70 km every 10 years! The favourable position of the large Siberian rivers - Ob, Yenisey and Lena - can easily provide ample irrigation. Siberia is developing.However, there is a downside. Frequent floods seriously damage the infrastructure designed to exist in permafrost. Methane explosions dot the entire Siberia with perfectly round, giant holes. Fascinating, but hardly appealing to local residents."
"The widespread introduction of new technologies and paperless media have allowed the planet to go green again. The terrible, barren patches in the Amazon tropical forests, the Russian Taiga forests, and even the virtually wiped-out Borneo forests have been completely restored. This was realised by scientists, environmental organisations, and, most importantly, thanks to the rejection of printed paper books: children don’t require textbooks, fathers don’t need novels, and grandfathers no longer want printed newspapers. New technologies have brought back the beauty of our planet and the joy of clean air."
"Bionic prostheses have appeared: mechanical limbs controlled by software. After receiving an impulse from the brain, the program converts it into a certain action, so that the functions of an artificial arm or leg are virtually indistinguishable from a real limb. Moreover, it can even transfer tactile sensations to its owner."
Rampaging in crowded places and getting away with is no longer possible: Law enforcement agencies learn about all participants of unsanctioned protests and demonstrations. Microscopic sensors that stick to clothes and skin are sprayed over crowds; enabling police to track and prosecute every rioter.
"Patrolling disadvantaged areas, policing at football matches and other hazardous police duties are delegated to robots. Mechanical policemen, resembling people, are able to recognise speech and engage in dialogue, work in groups, if necessary, and even have weapons at their disposal - though non-lethal: just tasers. But even with such ammunition RoboCop would be very dangerous should it fall into the wrong hands, so a special emphasis is placed on its anti-hacking software protection."
"Riots caused by food shortages have swept across many regions of the world. The international community is facing collapse due to the fact that the demand for food is constantly exceeding production capabilities.According to experts, the growing demand is exacerbated by such factors as climate change, water shortages, continuing globalisation and increasing political instability.Unprecedented population growth and changes in consumption patterns along with the economic development of a number of countries place ever-increasing pressure on mankind to meet the demand for food."
"The internal combustion engine is becoming outdated: it is going to be replaced in the environmental technology market by eco-tecnology. In particular, by vehicles with a rigid sail on the roof, which automatically rotates with the wind. Of course, the wind does not push the car forward like a sailing boat, instead, its energy is captured and converted into electricity. In addition, the sail also functions as a solar panel, which transfers the energy required for the movement of a car from this heavenly body."
"No more traffic jams and the stress of the commute! There is no sense in spending all day in the office. What is more, the majority of employees don’t have an office. If the head of department lives in Australia and his colleague is in Guatemala, this does not prevent them from working on a new mutual project. Regular online meetings allow them to coordinate the overall direction of the work. And the working day itself passes in the comfort of your home, in an armchair, in slippers, with a cup of tea, waiting for a home cooked lunch, prepared in your own kitchen by a caring chef robot."
"Ambitious expectations of building a career are on their way out - by 2040 it won’t make sense to anyone. The emphasis is shifting towards small business and freelance. According to futurologists, these forms of business will form the basis of the world economy, rather than multinational corporations.The very nature of work will change: instead of monotonous day-to-day work, the labor market will opt for people who work part-time in several places and on certain projects lasting from several days to several months. Everyone will be able to regulate the intensity of their working life: it may be one or two projects in six months, or five or six or more per month.In this regard, traditional offices and associated infrastructure will be gradually substituted by new formats – co-working and anti-cafes - where business, communication and food intake all happen in the same room.Big business will have to think not only of searching for competent professionals, but also of ensuring the security of corporate information. After all, no one can guarantee that the contracted employee does not work at the same time for a dozen of its competitors."
"The principles of neurocommunication fit in perfectly with the lifestyle of World Wide Web residents. Fully-fledged hotbeds of the NeuroNet are emerging and gradually expanding. Scientists accept the thesis of social consciousness, thinking and mentality, and pass from brain modelling to the modelling of groups. Attempts are being made to collect the hybrid model of the mind, the first neurocollectives are formed.Neurointerfaces based on visualisation of magnetic fields of the brain are just as common as mobile phones once were. People, intelligent agents and even pets can become participants of the Network on equal terms. Imagine that your dog no longer being lonely when you are not around. It is no longer a problem to contact your pet through the NeuroNet and send him a a few comforting thoughts."
"In order to improve the quality of recreation and life in general, engineers have attended to the task of reducing irritants during the night (light, shrill sounds, background noise, etc.). The production of equipment, machinery, motors that emanate high levels of noise is legally restricted. Architects are beginning to apply innovative materials and designs for extra noise and light blocking.Now people sleep much less, while maintaining normal vital activity - 5.5 hours is enough for an average person. Partly, this was provided by genetic engineering, and partly – by progress in the field of medical devices and pharmaceuticals.This, of course, does not mean that a person should disregard the importance of a good night's sleep and pleasant dreams. But the much-loathed alarm clocks can be thrown away once and for all. Go to bed after midnight and meet sunrise with a smile - easy!"
"Information in a text format all but disappears, giving way to its visual embodiment. First, newspapers went out of business, having, predictably, lost the battle with the Internet. They have disappeared in developed countries. Books are going to face the same fate soon. People’s ability to perceive textual information worsens: electronic gadgets have taught them to visualise, which is easier for comprehension. Educational programs are based on visual information, which makes them more primitive and shallow. An in-depth education on the basis of textual information has become a rarity, available only to the rich - it has strengthened the stratification of society according to education and intellect."
"Counters in catering establishments are replaced by touch screens. You can flick through the menu and order something, and, while you wait for the food, you can watch a movie, read the news or have fun playing a computer game. When a visitor is ready to go, the table will bill him or her and accept payment. But that's not all: a smart table is able to recognise regular customers and recommend dishes based on their tastes. And the savings are passed on to the customer: all waiters and cooks are robots – they don’t need your tips."
"The idea of mobility and independence is embodied in the housing. Many experts who often move from one place to another opt for mobile container homes - mini-lofts - instead of constantly changing houses and flats. Their total area is small - 50-60 square meters - but the space is well thought-out, and all the functions and features of the house can be controlled by intelligent systems. But most importantly, this container home is completely portable. It can be easily delivered to any point of the globe and installed even in remote places -  on the roof of an office building, or even a rocky ocean shore. ""Home-cube"" assembling takes only three days. Most notably, mini-lofts ""inhabit"" the business capitals of the world - New York and Shanghai. There are entire areas filled with such constructions. Container homes are very diverse in terms of pricing and appearance – ranging from simple minimalist solutions to high-tech and elite versions created by famous designers."
"Rock and mountain climbing equipment makes use of materials with the texture and qualities of a gecko's toe pads. These lizards are renowned for their ability to hold on to and traverse surfaces vertically or even upside down. They are effective on walls, ceilings, glass or any other smooth surface. With the application of nano-material to special boots and gloves, humans can also grip any surface which makes many extreme sports and other types of entertainment safer and more widely accessible."
"Children are no longer required to keep their arms on the desk and straighten their backs. They all have comfortable, ergonomic chairs, adapting to each student, and the surface of a desk has turned into a multifunctional space that participates actively in the learning process. It is possible to write and draw on it with a finger or with electronic pens and pencils, it is able to create 3D models of everything: atoms, star constellations, ant hills; students read e-books and pass tests right there at the desk."
"In accordance with the national security program, the system of bio-repositories was established in most developed countries. These are stores of biological material samples and a database of genomic information of each inhabitant of the country. To implement this program, every citizen has at least one bio-tech implant.A Bio-implant monitors the human health condition according to several parameters and sends this information to the database, in particular, data on the exacerbation of chronic diseases. This makes it possible to optimise the costs of health care and pay more attention to disease prevention.Bio-implants will help to reduce the mortality rate caused by a sudden exacerbation of chronic diseases, for example, heart diseases."
"All kitchen appliances are integrated in a single system under the control of a computer. It communicates with the owner through a three-dimensional hologram of the chef, which offers a choice of food and drinks. You can just input the menu for the day: The kitchen will prepare the ordered food for the designated time automatically. A Smart kitchen can buy missing ingredients through the Internet - therefore it has access to the bank account of the owner and should be protected from cyber criminals."
"There is much more space in apartments due to the cavity wall modules, which are built in large interior objects: furniture and household appliances. The desired object unfolds or moves out of its compartment by pressing a button. Thus, the space can be easily rearranged: depending on the current needs, the same space can become a comfortable living room or a functional kitchen."
"Despite the fact that the problem of Internet addiction was seemingly obvious and widespread, it couldn’t be thoroughly studied, primarily due to a lack of clear criteria for its diagnosis. Statistical data on this disorder were very different. For many years, there have been attempts to officially recognise Internet addiction and include it in the WHO classification, but only now have they achieved this.Finally, society has realised that this disorder is a real cyber threat to humankind. Almost all children grow up in a world full of virtual events and images, they become accustomed to interacting with them on the Web. They are less likely to go out and interact with others, suffer from a lack of sleep, poor eating habits, do sports rarely, and have several other addictions. Constantly turning to internet search engines to get information is a habit that worsens memory, because users do not need to store information in their brain as they can easily obtain it at any time.However, the most dangerous aspect of Internet addiction is not the mental disorder that strikes some individuals, but social problems in general. Having developed only one a virtual way of solving problems the younger generation can’t consider other, real, ways. They fail or even refuse to participate in society if the government does not provide them with the opportunity to express their will through online services. The nightmare of any democratic system - completely empty polling stations - may well become a reality."
"New channels of communication do not substitute the old ""classical"" methods which can incite major, even global conflicts. The worldwide reach of the Internet in general and social networks, in particular, gives almost unlimited possibilities for the manipulation of mass consciousness.Politicians are actively using the Internet to influence the electorate or to lobby for the interests of private companies. Aggressive religions and sects recruit their supporters among the unsuspecting users of seemingly innocuous sites. Protests organised through the Internet are so massive that they can be regarded as direct outside interference in the internal affairs of countries.In fact, mass consciousness manipulation through the World Wide Web represents one of the most important strategic technologies of modern hybrid wars. Hope rests with the fact that history repeats itself: people still aren’t able to unite and resist the global cyber threats using their enemies’ technical possibilities."
"We draw a banner with cyber insurance advertisement.An accelerated transition to digital business, as well as a strengthening of links between IT-systems, make cyber threats one of the major global problems of commercial companies. The risk of financial losses is increasing to such an extent that businesses start to take a great interest in their insurance: over the last decade, the volume of this market has increased by more than 10 times.Big Data benefits the active development of insurance against cyber technology. It enables real-time monitoring and evaluation of the level of danger, and partial management of IT-risks by traders. All major insurance companies, which once guaranteed protection against the loss of movable and immovable property, are now also advertising cyber insurance - for businesses and for individuals."
"The international community is contemplating legislative prohibition on the use of virtual space for computer wars. Such unprecedented measures are caused by frequent cases of cyber-attacks on government offices, the world's major financial and business centres and the key infrastructure facilities.With increasing frequency, cybercriminals disrupt the operation of the computer systems that control military equipment and provide support and security for civilian facilities: telephone, water supply, power plants and electrical grids, fire protection, transport, etc. At best, this results in facilities being temporally disabled. But it is scary to even think about the consequences of a large-scale planned cyber attack on a nuclear power plant or a nuclear weapon station."
"After the world’s first satellite designed for quantum science experiments had been successfully launched in August 2016, China entered the active phase of experiments based on the technology of quantum teleportation. For the first time in the history of the world, it is possible to transfer quantum information from the satellite to the Earth. The equipment installed in “Mozi” creates a secure communication channel between Beijing and Vienna, considered almost unhackable.Two years later, the Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS) mission is accomplished with very encouraging results. This makes it possible to combine the efforts of the Chinese and European scientists and to build Asian-European network based on quantum encryption keys."
"Two-thirds of the world's cocoa was produced in the African continent. But with drought, soil depletion, the resulting decrease in yields, farmers fleeing from abusive working conditions, cocoa prices went up sharply around the world. Pralines and other confectionery are now produced from tomatoes, dandelion, burdock and sweet kinds of vegetables. Real chocolate bars and candies are an expensive rarity on par with caviar and truffles.Similar reasons cause an incredibly high cost of coffee, The most popular types are disappearing. Their growing area is right in the firing line of global warming. Peanuts and peanut butter are on the culinary ‘endangered’ list."
"Road surfaces are now a multifunctional complex, which serve to complete a number of tasks. The use of nano-additives from waste tires makes the paving more secure, environmentally friendly, durable, and therefore economical.Lighting systems, which turn on only when a moving vehicle is detected, as well as fluorescent glow-in-the-dark road markings, accumulating solar energy during the day, will significantly reduce electricity costs and, at the same time, improve road safety.With built-in auto induction lanes, it will be possible to charge the car during the ride, and special sensors will inform drivers about the climatic conditions of the area and the state of the road surface."
"Vessels with no living soul aboard navigate vast oceans. These are not ghost ships, but real tankers, bulk carriers and container ships. This is possible thanks to the ‘Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Applications’ (AAWA) project that was launched in 2015 and has become fully-fledged and widespread. Today, millions of tons of freight cross the oceans in all directions without immediate human intervention, which saves money and makes sea freight transportation safe and effective."
"The advantage of Big Data compared to traditional scientific methods is obvious, however, there are justified concerns that their application will lead to total surveillance and violation of civil liberties. Confidentiality and security of personal information is not guaranteed, not only online, but also in everyday life.The paradox is that the fundamental principle of Big Data contains a threat: if there is a large amount of data, anonymisation is not possible altogether despite all attempts to make it otherwise.Scientists are trying to offer solutions to the problem of cyber security, but the reality is that , to exist in the modern world, you have to come to terms with total surveillance. Your mobile phone, a ""smart"" billboard near your house, a flock of drones with cameras or an ordinary coffee machine – they all are helping ""Big Brother"" to eavesdrop on your personal life."
"A new ISS development strategy demanded technological breakthroughs. Traditional metal structures are being replaced with sophisticated inflatable modules with a flexible membrane. They are delivered to the orbit in a folded state, connected to the station by a robotic arm and then inflated to the required size. Tests have shown that these new modules can perfectly withstand the blows of micrometeorites and prevent cosmic rays passing into the station. The problem of fragility and possible air leaks has been resolved relatively quickly – its shell bears little resemblance to the balloon, rather it resembles a thick tire, wrapped in a coating resembling kevlar.Expandable modules are more flexible and much easier to manufacture than hard metal structures, which greatly reduces their delivery cost to the ISS. They are more suited to cope with a variety of  tasks. Inflatable modules can be connected to each other and create even larger specialised objects with a greater payload."
"Trained dolphins have been serving people ever since the Second World War. Now,  Man has finally managed to domesticate dolphins in their natural habitat and utilise their intelligence for his own means. Now, dolphins help man to fish – just as was the case with dogs and hunting.Dolphin language is decrypted. They are commanded to find fish and make them swim to the designated location. Thus, they direct schools of fish to fishing vessels using their sonar and innate instincts.More than that, fish farms in the wild are widespread. There, dolphins also make an invaluable contribution as underwater herders."
"Mounding of artificial islands and archipelagos, the method that was used to create a row of islands in the United Arab Emirates, has allowed many countries to recover their territories once lost to global warming and rising of sea levels. Thanks to modern technology, some countries have substantially increased their territory. The problem of overpopulation has become nonexistent. At the same time, the problem of oceanic waste utilisation has been solved: It is recycled, it makes up the building basis for artificial islands and archipelagos. Once again, modern technology has harnessed something that previously caused environmental concerns, to serve humankind. Also, thanks to this technology, people can change geographical features at will, transforming an island into a peninsula. Finally, the UK has become a part of mainland Europe."
"Unique coral reef ecosystems, which could have disappeared by now, are rescued due to 3D-printers. With their help, collapsing corals are replaced by replications which imitate real corals not only externally, but also internally: they have a system of tunnels and caves necessary for the reef inhabitants."
"Numerous farms and plantations for algae cultivation are built in the vastness of the oceans. This is an agricultural breakthrough that eliminated wasting time and money on weeding and watering. Harvesting is carried out by robots. There are monetary savings as well as a more efficient use of natural resources (such as conservation of fresh water used in on-land agriculture) This leads directly to ecological and nutritional benefits. There are fantastic yields, rich in protein and micro-elements. The food industry has learned to process and produce high volumes of delicious, nutritious and healthy food. Additionally, algae is used to absorb excess nitrogen from the atmosphere and produce environmentally friendly fuel."
"According to credible sources, the Internet can be accessed on over 85% of the Earth's surface. Internet access is mostly wireless and very cheap. There are special projects for the poorest parts of the Earth, which provide access to the global network for free. However, it includes only a set of basic applications for smartphones.Zuckerberg’s Aquila project also makes for the spread of the Internet. This is a unique park of drones. The signal emitted by a drone is received by antennas of small towers, which transform it into a Wi-Fi signal for 4G-networks. Due to this, everyone within a 70 kilometer radius, can access the Internet. The wingspan of Aquila is wider than that of Boeing 737, it weighs a hundred times less, and its power consumption can be compared to two or three hair dryers.Now a person who broadcasts online from the Amazon rainforest, or instantly posts photos directly from Tibetan mountain ranges comes as no surprise."
"What once caused so much destruction and loss is finally bringing benefits to people. Corrosive bacteria have been known since the XX century when they were thought of as a menace but now, after a small genetic adjustment, they began to serve humanity.Now you do not need to waste time on the complicated and expensive dismantling of old railway bridge pillars. Special robots apply a solution that contains bacteria-metal eaters, and after a while, without noise, dust and unnecessary costs, the old bridge pillars will disappear without a trace. Also, useless railways are disposed of the same way. The ecological balance is restored thanks to modern technology."
"Never before in the history of mankind has the role of energy from renewable sources been so crucial. 30% of global electrical energy is ""clean"" and produced by the sun, wind, tide and other renewable sources. It is still, however, experimental.Investments in the development of new sources of ""clean"" energy and modernisation of those already known amounted to nearly $ 400 billion. Due to this, harmful emissions into the atmosphere have been reduced by 1.1 billion tons per year, and this number continues to increase."
"We draw a blank ads banner, two people are looking at it and each of them sees their own advertising projection.Marketers and advertisers were among the first to take interest in Big Data technologies, and now they are enjoying the benefits. They use a huge variety of data from telecommunications service providers, including geolocation, gender, age, marital status of subscribers to make sure that advertising was as precise as possible.It is possible to change the content of the advertising message, depending on the preferences of people who are close by. Micro-sensors embedded in the outer media identify people through the chips in their mobile phones, credit cards and other personal belongings. Then, an ad request can not only be formed, but also be transmitted individually. For example, a pair of ultrasonic beams deliver localised audio message that can be heard only by one person. Announcements can be personal and unique even in the most crowded places.Psychologists and human rights activists are concerned about the massive use of these technologies, because the personal information involved in global projects threatens the privacy and protection of personal data. But business interests seem to override for now. Mankind still relies on cybersecurity systems designed to prevent attackers from obtaining the data."
"The World Health Organisation issues a statement claiming that the HIV-AIDS epidemic is considered to be localised and eradicated. The statement also claims that the main obstacle for the localisation of the epidemic was the fact that a large number of people infected with the virus were unaware of it. An invaluable factor in the defeat of the epidemic were awareness-raising activities, as well as greater access to treatment, which increased the number of HIV-infected people seeking medical help.The situation was also improved due to one-off rapid tests for HIV \ AIDS. One drop of blood put on a small piece of paper detects the presence of the virus with 100% accuracy. In all cities, there are automatic terminals for conducting tests for HIV \ AIDS. Testers are available in all public areas. In addition, in most countries, treatment for HIV \ AIDS can take place on an anonymous outpatient basis."
"Cars that are able to transform depending on the traffic specifics have become widespread. If a long journey awaits you, a car of a medium size sprouts wings and moves through the air; and in dense urban traffic it turns back into a compact city car."
"Synthetic biology changes our lives as profoundly as the internet did. As you remember, self-taught hackers and gamers contributed to the development of the latter. We see history repeating - Many breakthrough innovations in synthetic biology come from ordinary people - from self-taught biologists and chemists.Synthetic biology is a new scientific field that brings together engineers, physicists, molecular biologists and chemists in order to use engineering principles to connect bio-molecular components - genes, proteins and other components - to form structures and networks. These updated structures are supposed to reprogram living organisms, giving them new properties.Chicken eggs that will never give a life to a chicken, but come with an almost-ready omelette  inside (only a pinch of salt needed!); meat with certain dietary properties that can be obtained without the slaughter of animals.We have animal-spies, whose hearing and vision is transmitted to a micro-screen - these are just some of the possible ""products"" of synthetic biology."
"On the dashboard, we draw a screen that transmits information about neighbouring cars to the driver, their insurance record and assesses the probability of collision.Vehicles are connected to form a single network and are in constant interaction. This allows you to carry out all kinds of manoeuvres quickly and safely: overtaking, changing lanes and turning. Thanks to this coordinated information exchange, traffic congestion and jams become much less severe. Moreover, cars can ride behind each other at a distance of only 20 cm, which saves space on the road and energy (the front vehicle protects the one behind from the oncoming wind flow). Of course, such a complex computer network responsible for  people’s safety needs 100% protection against cyber attacks, and the most qualified specialists work in this field."
"We draw a company office where several people sit surrounded by servers and robots carrying out the work.The application area of portable electronic devices is expanding, which leads to an increase in the number of ""paperless"" offices and a reduction in jobs where people can be replaced by computers - banks, insurance companies, offices, etc.Companies seek to reduce administrative expenses - offices maintenance, rent payment, staff salaries - replacing it with high-tech computer programs, video conferencing equipment and remote workstations.On the one hand, these ""e-employees"" will not fall foul of ‘the human factor’, on the other hand - issues of security and information protection become paramount."
"Development and improvement of virtual reality, the use of the Internet for educational, working and career purposes led to a distinct isolation of the individual. The number of married couples has been steadily decreasing, the value of the institution of marriage itself is minimised. Communication and entertainment is via the Internet. A person can engage in sexual relations before marriage, and the status “unmarried” has long lost its negative connotations in the eyes of society. A family created with the sole purpose of raising children gradually ceases to be regarded as a necessity. Science offers more reliable ways of conception, so there is no need for a permanent partner or marriage.Thus, in the near future we are likely to witness the revival of small-sized apartments, studios designed for a single resident, with comfortable minimalist interior, stuffed with electronics, a single bed and cars. Six person dinnerware sets, family seating, as well as  heirlooms will exist only in old books."
"Now, you can hold a business meeting or a romantic dinner in an unforgettable place. Imagine soft music, delicious food, and the vast space of the ocean around you - A myriad of fish float by, fancy seaweed and kelp sway, underwater life goes on all around you, as faint beams of light strafe the several meters of water above. It is romantic, it is unforgettable. What is more, it's available and real. Just one thing -  As with all good restaurants, it is recommended to book tables in advance."
"Work in the MOE became much safer after anthropomorphic robots had been introduced. They replace people in situations when the life of a rescuer is at risk: a huge fire with toxic gas emissions, the possibility of explosion. As for rescuers, they have mechanical exoskeletons at their disposal, which increases their muscle strength when removing the debris and protects them from falling objects."
"We draw a system of sensors scattered around the cityUnique information generation and its transmission is not tasked to humans. Most industrial devices and objects - from very small details to huge systems – are equipped with environmental sensors. Why not put all this information to use and manage complex technical systems in real time? Not only to understand what  is happening at the moment, but what problems can possibly emerge in the nearest future, and how to prevent them with minimum effort. A perfect example of such preventative management is ""Smart City"". The coordination centre is flooded with terabytes of information from a huge number of sources: on the slightest weather changes, the state of emergency services, the numbers of cars, pipeline and energy systems, the number of employees working for companies who are at their workplace at the moment -Everything that could possibly be relevant to the life of a megapolis. Information is gathered, analysed, and a recommendation is given: a node is damaged, in order to avoid the blackout of the whole block, it should be replaced as soon as possible. Or to urgently call out 7 more cardiologists and 20 nurses. Or to reduce the heating of some buildings in 3 hours, because warming is predicted in the area."
"We draw: a picket of several robots in the centre of the city with posters where slogans in binary code are written.The Widespread development of robots and artificial intelligence have necessitated the creation of an appropriate legal framework. A set of documents that regulates the rights of intelligent robots has been elaborated. Subsequently, this code is constantly updated and improved."
"The construction of the long-awaited tunnel that has established a convenient and high-speed transport link between continental Europe and Scandinavia has been finished. It connects the German island of Fehmarn and the Danish island of Lolland.Initially, A bridge was planned, but a tunnel subsequently replaced this project, as it significantly reduced risks and negative environmental impact while the cost of construction remained comparable.The 18-kilometre precast concrete structure has a rectangular cross-section of about 40 meters and is 10 meters long. There are four separate corridors within – two for cars and two for high-speed trains. Because of difficulties with the German bureaucratic system, construction completion was postponed several times. But now the journey from Scandinavia to Europe takes only 10 minutes for the cars drivers and 7 minutes for high-speed trains. It is assumed that the tunnel will last without major repairs until 2140."
"3D-printers are affordable for any person on an average income and have become a standard household appliance. It suffices to download a model of a desired item from the Internet and send it to the printer. Its dimensions are limited by the printable area: richer people can afford expensive equipment capable of creating large objects; lower-end models can only cope with tiny objects. These devices can print office supplies, furniture and simple technology.A 3D printer can befound in every family home, as ubiquitous as a fridge or an iron werepreviously. Polymers necessary for the process of printing can beused multiple times. And now no one throws old boots or handbagsaway: They are placed in the recycling compartment and a program isset- Brand new designer clothes to your exact specifications. Goneare huge waste dumpsites. Ecological pressure is removed from theurban environment. And wardrobes have reduced in size - thanks tomodern technology."
"Every car buyer can have a shot at car design: the frame remains standard, but the body can be designed independently in the program for three-dimensional modeling. The body is printed by manufacturer with the help of a 3D-printer and delivered to the customer in a ready-to-use condition."
"Trendy ladies and gentlemen no longer need to try on clothes in front of the mirror. Smart Mirrors are able to demonstrate not only a real reflection, but also to show it with any article of clothing in various combinations. And they can also enable women to look at their appearance with different make-up options."
"Graphene (A carbon modification: one atom thick) has found its application in light industry. The structure of graphene, ‘installed’ into the fabric fibres, helped to create T-shirts and shirts that do not get dirty and do not wear out for up to 200 years. Graphene textiles can be given different, sometimes even opposite properties: for example, it can be waterproof and used as the fabric for diving equipment, or vice versa, be moisture wicking, which is essential for sportswear destined for high quantities of moisture. ‘Smart’ textile does not lose its form and has the properties of shape and temperature memory, releasing additional layers of insulation as the temperature decreases, and compressing them, when it gets hot."
"Chinese engineers have created a special fabric coating made of titanium dioxide with self-cleaning properties and the ability to kill bacteria. This material can be used to create, for example, super-socks: always clean; no washing required, which means that the second sock will no longer be lost in the washing machine. Holding them in the sun for awhile will get rid of stains. Additionally, the antibacterial properties of the coating ensure skin health and absence of foot odor."
"Finally, officeworkers can be sure that the food they have brought for lunch won’t be eaten by anyone else - other people's food (either my mistake ormaliciously)  cannot be taken from the refrigerator. This applianceis equipped with a biometric handle, which, when touched, scans fingerprints and only provides access to one personal cell.Source: Link to the original article about this study in INC, an American monthly business magazine targeted at the start-ups and small and medium-sized business owners, one of the oldest and most popular publications in this field."
"The central areas of big cities have turned into a green zone, where only the means of transportation allowed are bicycles. At the same time, by rotating the pedals, the cyclist generates electric power - and then, if he or she is in a hurry, a bicycle can be switched to a scooter mode. If it is necessary to cover a long distance, a bicycle can be folded and placed under a bus or taxi seat. Furthermore, the electricity accumulated can be used a transportation fare."
"Traditional linear TV has finally sunk into oblivion, giving way to streaming. This is not surprising, because Internet TV offers the viewer the opportunity to manage content: watch programs at the viewer’s convenience,pause, rewind or fast-forward at your leisure. Moreover, the signal transmission quality is improving every year. TV sets also have changed dramatically: now they are small boxes projecting the image on any flat surface."
"Armchairs have become as convenient as possible for anyone who sits in them. An Integrated computer recognises body parameters, makes calculations - The backrest and seat take the necessary shape and position, which facilitates maximum comfort."
"Windowpanes were replaced with widescreen monitors, which enable you to watch a movie or play a console game; and if the view from the window is not inspiring - just choose a landscape to your taste instead. However, all these options are easy to turn off, after which the panel looks like ordinary transparent glass."
